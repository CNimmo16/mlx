# MLX course

## Setup

1. Ensure Python is installed, use venv if needed
2. Install pipenv with `pip install pipenv`
3. Install dependencies with `pipenv install`

## Running scripts

Use `pipenv run python <path-to-script>` to ensure that the dependencies are available.

If pipenv run is unable to find python, check that the python version in the Pipfile matches the installed version
