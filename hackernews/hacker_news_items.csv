Sure, you might not be able to replicate KMP in the middle of an interview if you didn't already know it, but I'd certainly expect any competent programmer to be able to come up with some form of solution (and I'd probably expect them to get reasonably close to KMP) reasonably quickly and then to be able to discuss their solution and identify it's flaws. A moderately intelligent version ought to be fairly trivial for someone with a solid comp-sci grounding.<p>Even then, it's not the coded solution that I'm particularly interested in - it's the explanation that follows about how you got to that solution and the discussion about the pros and cons of your particular implementation. I'm looking for signs that you can solve problems and that you can look at your solutions with a critical eye and understand their weaknesses as well.<p>For what it's worth, the nastiest interview question I've ever had involved building and searching interval trees with up to a billion intervals stored in it where they were looking for solutions which provided the fastest posible search times.

3935527,,comment,Sanddancer,2012-05-06 17:39:10,"Honestly, as others pointed out, the multitude of sins of omissions that MySQL has performed over the years. For example, its silently ignoring the foreign key constraints on certain database engines, such as MyISAM. On top of that, the repeated and continuing promises of actually implementing features like foreign keys in many of their database engines, including their high-performance NDB engine, means that the programmer has to do a lot more bookkeeping work on things that are built in on more rational databases.<p>The multiple database engine mess leads to its own problems compared to engines like postgresql. Do you use the InnoDB engine, and rely on third-party products, like galera, for clustering, or do you use NDB and suffer its weaknesses in referential integrity, and difficulty in configuration?<p>Finally, you get into issues where MySQL isn't nearly as featureful as PostgreSQL. For example, PostgreSQL supports a multitude of languages for creating server-side procedural functions -- pgsql, perl, python, tcl, etc, whereas MySQL only supports C, and only pre-compiled functions. This limits the utility, and leads to these quite useful features being left by the wayside because numerous coders were weaned on a database that didn't support doing these nice things for them.<p>While mysql does have certain uses, I'd argue severely that postgresql is a much better designed foundation for working on new projects. The attention to detail, the emphasis on not eating your data, and the level of features means that you can spend more time coding, and in the language you want to use, and less time fiddling with your database software.",3934286,,,,,

I have yet to see any Japanese concerted effort from Japanese carriers to create an iPhone like device.  Since the iPhone, it has been more or less status quo in Japan, with the Japanese devices focusing more on new gimmicky features like solar powered recharging or a ""3D display"", rather than focusing on improving overall usability.<p>Sure, Japanese TV covered the launch this morning, showing people lining up to buy the iPhone.  But that's just because Japanese TV likes to show people lining up for things, be it the opening of the hottest new fashion store, or some ramen shop.

Suppressors are highly controlled Federally, and completely illegal to own in Illinois (and Iowa and Michigan and a number of other states as well). You may think that doesn't matter to criminals, but most illegal firearms are purchased legally at some point-- not gonna happen for suppressors. And they aren't mix-and-match; you need a threaded barrel for your gun specifically. (There's a nice little scene in Goodfellas about this problem.)<p>But let's say you get ahold of one. You've got a line with a crooked Class 3 dealer in Indiana (this is someone who is also allowed to sell machine guns and grenade launchers) and he decides he's gonna risk his life by selling to a gang banger. Fair enough. So you get home, you load up your 9mm, screw on your shiny new suppressor, and go outside to take a potshot at some asshole you got beef with. Two minutes later, a couple of squad cars show up, lights flashing.<p>What happened? Well, you got your suppressor, but you're still using your same old bog-standard black-market ammunition. The can turns the hearing-damaging bang of your gun into a merely very loud bang, but it does nothing about the supersonic crack your bullet makes. You were quieter, but far from <i>quiet</i>; a ShotSpotter that was close enough easily picked you out.<p>If your dealer was looking out for you, he would have mentioned this, and recommended you switch to a subsonic ammunition. If he was really looking out for you, he'd also mention that this ammunition has significantly reduced range and stopping power, and probably does not have enough operating pressure to reliably cycle your automatic-- meaning you need to cock your gun every other shot like Jack Bauer. Sounds pretty much ideal for your inner-city gang fight, right?<p>And lest we forget, when the fuzz finally catches up to you, whether with the ShotSpotter or with good-old-fashioned police work, you are not going to get slapped with possession and sent upstate. As soon as that suppressor gets entered into evidence, with its nicely filed-down serial number, they're going to make a phone call, and the ATF is going to come to town with some serious Federal prosecution heat. They will hang you up by your toes until you tell them who sold the thing to you, and then they will find that person and make them severely wish that they had not.<p>So... yeah.

4035879,,comment,creamyhorror,2012-05-29 04:53:17,"Glad you asked. To us in Singapore, the South Koreans and Japanese actually look a tad excessive (what with their headbands and everything in that article). But it's more likely just a function of how they display their emphasis on school testing. We probably care as much about test results, but don't display it in the same way.<p>Test results matter when a majority of successful people got where they were because of their results. They did well in school and got good jobs (often in foreign MNCs); not many started their own businesses. Add to this the cultural motivation of wanting to keep up with the Joneses (being 'kiasu', in our lingo) and you have a strong incentive for parents to be all ""responsible"" for their kid by making sure she gets tutoring in whatever subjects she's weak in and she does additional practice outside of homework, often at a harder level than in school.<p>And of course, in the good schools, the ones that take in a higher-scoring crop of students, the teachers create harder test papers for their students to keep them motivated (we can't have everyone getting As now, can we?), and so parents go to tutoring companies with ""challenging"" or ""enriching"" programmes to make sure their kids keep up. The problems at this end of the pool get a bit ridiculous, and people end up complaining: <a href=""http://everythingalsocomplain.com/2011/09/10/primary-6-maths-exam-question-too-tough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everythingalsocomplain.com/2011/09/10/primary-6-maths...</a><p>The tide is turning slightly as new parents, freshly emerged from the competitive sea of schooling, take a less intense view of the importance of academic performance, and recognise that there are other paths that their kids can take in life that don't rely on test scores. We've opened specialist schools in arts, music, sports and design in recent years. But there's still a heavy economic pressure to do well and get good jobs in finance, medicine, law and so on, so I don't expect the culture of focus on education will weaken significantly in the near future.<p>I think the fundamentally different culture of American schools means that many Asian approaches will never transfer well; but there are still improvements that can be made, e.g. in the area of curriculum, in teacher training and ongoing development, etc. American schools are incredibly diverse in populations and practices; they have big weaknesses and big strengths. I think it would be good to have a unified tough-but-capable program for the struggling schools in poorer neighbourhoods, while letting strong/specialised schools do their thing. That would be something like the best of both worlds.",4035801,,,,,

4035883,,comment,tzs,2012-05-29 04:53:41,"Ah, I remember that time well. After graduating from Caltech in 1982, and then spending a month at a defense contractor (hired for an interesting project, project got cancelled before I started, and the alternative work they found for me sucked), I went to APh Technological Consulting, a Pasadena company consisting mostly of Caltech engineering graduates.<p>APh had done the electronics design, system software, development system, and early games for Mattel for the Mattel Intellivision. There were some amazing people there. Perhaps most memorable was Hal Finney, who later became well known as the second developer hired by PGP Corporation and as a cryptographic activist.<p>We were working on the next generation Intellivision when the crash happened (and I got laid off). APh was designing a new, much more powerful, GPU for the new system. For the prototype units we developed on the GPU consisted of a card cage with several hand wire wrapped circuit boards.<p>For everyone who was NOT Hal, this was a fairly typical occurrence:<p>1. work until very very late on your game, which is supposed to be shown at a closed demo at CES. Finally, you just have to go take sleep. Do so.<p>2. get back to work and you find a note from the hardware guys. They've rewired your GPU, adding or removing registers, changing graphics modes, sprite handling, and so on.<p>3. rewrite your code to deal with the hardware changes. Since all the code was in assembly language (for the annoying GI1620 processor), this was non-trivial and time consuming.<p>Somehow, Hal was immune to this. He could fix up his assembly code to cope with any change the hardware people made in just a few minutes.<p>Anyway, the article's point about poor quality third party games eroding consumer confidence is correct.<p>The first group of third party developers were fine. Activision was formed by former Atari developers. They knew the Atari system in and out, and could produce top quality games. Imagic was formed by Atari and Mattel people, and there were some former APh people there too. They understood the Intellivision and could produce top quality games.<p>The second generation of third party developers did not have that kind of knowledge. We saw independent Intellivison games that didn't take any advantage of the Intellivision system software--they just talked directly to the hardware. These games were almost all crap. The Intellivision firmware essentially consisted of a small game oriented operating system. It would let you do things like give it a sequence of images and a rate and it would animate a sprite with those images at that rate for you. You could give it a velocity and it would move that sprite for you. You could register event handlers that it would call when things collided, when controls were pressed, and so on.<p>It was that system software that let APh and Mattel write complex games like Baseball when limited to a 1k cartridge (actually, Baseball may have been a 2K cartridge) and something like 320 bytes of RAM. If you didn't take advantage of that system software and so had to do all that animation and event handling and hardware management code yourself you either had to restrict yourself to much simpler games, or you had to make a cartridge with bigger ROM and onboard RAM, which would greatly increase the price of your game.",4035279,,,,,

5036101,,comment,Crake,2013-01-10 09:00:16,"Unless you have no contact with your parents, of course. Or they're just assholes who refuse to provide you with their tax returns. Most private schools won't give you aid unless you fill out their own specialized financial aid forms, like the CSS profile. Even if you're classified as an independent student on the FAFSA (like I am), 99% of the private universities I've talked to say I'm ineligible for all of their scholarships/aid if I don't provide my parents' info. (Note: I'm age 24. Have been financially independent and living on my own since age 18.) If you're from a jerk family that won't help you with college, either by paying your tuition or providing their tax info, you're pretty much just fucked. It's also entirely possible to have a $0 contribution on the FAFSA and then like $30,000 or something on the CSS profile--private colleges can ignore the FAFSA and use their own definition of calculation of ""financial need,"" to ensure that you aren't found ""needy.""<p>Also, many of the top private universities don't take transfer students--non-elite students often have to work for a few years before attending college, and it's unpleasant to find out that having tried to take what community colleges you can afford in terms of time and money while holding down a full time job to keep a roof over your head has literally made you ineligible to apply almost anywhere except a state run university (who also tend to heavily discriminate against transfer students).<p>Even for your example, Stanford, transfer admissions are significantly more selective than normal admissions processes:<p>""Transfer admission is considerably more competitive than freshman admission. In recent years, the admit rate for transfer students has ranged from 1% to 4%. Between twenty and fifty transfer student spaces are typically available each year.""<p>This further increases the ability of Stanford to keep its student body composed of financial elites--while touting its ""generous"" financial aid policy. Plus, even an 18 year old applying to Stanford requires SATs, extracurriculars, etc that most of the non financial elite are unable to afford. Most college applications are at $80/pop nowadays; if you can only afford one college application, why pick the university you probably won't be accepted to?",5035514,{5036301},,,,

2885935,,comment,forkandwait,2011-08-15 08:35:19,"I keep trying to formulate my take on this, and failing, but here goes anyway:<p>The democratic party and American leftists no longer understand non-college working people and, for the most part, no longer reach out to them.  Working people think that the left today advocates either for weirdos or for the completely screwed up, and wants everybody to pay for its programs to help said weirdos and fuckups.  There is some valid  reason for this impression, with the Great Society programs and affirmative action in the sixties and seventies being partly funded by taxes on the middle classes, along with fiascos like school bussing and over-compensated hiring practices screwing over people who didn't feel like they deserved it.  (And poor management of government agencies making them ineffective at cost effective delivery of services.)<p>However, working people don't see themselves as fuckups (because they're not), and they don't have a lot of patience with weirdos.  So they aren't going to feel comfortable with the gay marriage/ social worker part of the left (the old union guys were socially very conservative for the most part).<p>Also, most of the left today seems to me to be made up of people who really have no connection to actual poor working class people, so there is automatically a divide that is mobilized by the Karl Roves of the world.<p>Furthermore, if you have ever been lower middle class or ""working poor"", you learn early that very traditional personal character values can make the difference between you and your family living in a <i>truly shitty</i> situation or rising out of the muck around you to actually have a decent marriage/ nice friends/ safe home.  So when college educated lefties come around and tell them to have pity on fuckups and weirdos because its society's fault, or that personal character and traditional values don't matter, any working class person is likely to tell them to go to hell.<p>So today's Republicans mobilize personal character rhetoric, traditionalism rhetoric, and the cultural non-understanding between leftist leadership and working people, and -- voila, working people voting against their own interests.<p>Until the left figures out the working classes again -- which means taking the time to show up in the middle of the country, go to church, eat ribs, etc, etc -- Capital will continue to screw everyone.  So quit whining about how stupid working class people are -- nobody represents their interests today, neither left nor right, but at least the Republicans pretend.",2885455,"{2886493,2886333,2886582,2886538,2886195,2889750,2886308,2886430}",,,,

If it is the employee's device, then <i>everything</i> belongs to the employee by default.<p>2. If the employer wants to allow access to certain company facilities or data using that device, then it is the employer's responsibility to ensure that such access complies with any necessary policies, without affecting anything that is none of the company's business.<p>3.

Hardly anyone INSIDE the medical profession cares about it. Entire entry-level careers have been created for ths type of thing (medical records specialist) because nobody who can do something else wants to do it.  I'm surprised your programmer ONLY wanted $6900 a month. Boredom is the real reason she didn't get much done and eventually left.

I had an experience similar to yours.  Nearly identical, aside from the duration and money involved. I didn't get paid as much and I bailed after 4 months. We even were using Python! I was the programmer. Other person was a doctor. Building some sort of medical record keeping startup thing. He was paying me ok, but not great. I had some laughably low percentage of the company. After the first two weeks, I alternated between wanting to kill him and wanting to kill myself. It sucked that bad. Medical record keeping is insanely boring. The programming issues are equivalently boring. It is like doing your taxes multiplied by 1000. It sucks. SUCKS. The hardest part of your programmer's day was probably mustering up the psychic energy needed to even fire up her text editor.  I'm almost having a nervous breakdown right now just thinking about it. You medical people have really gotten yourself into a record-keeping pickle.<p>Your only hope is to learn programming because any programmer that is any good will want to disembowel themselves working on this sort of project. There is a real opportunity here, because all this work is going to end up being done by huge mega consulting firms who specialize in these sorts of boring recordkeeping problems. They are going to charge $69,000,000 per month to do this.

If you pay them too much, you basically get an army of mercenaries, while the personal sacrifice any soldier send into harms way endures is impossible to truly translate to money.<p>We entrepreneurs often talk of our way of life as something we choose quite explicitly over financial security. I'm pretty sure the success of an army depends a lot on it's soldiers thinking roughly the same way about their chosen path.<p>Finally, my impression is that the United States is build on a certain mentality that's difficult for us Europeans to fully grasp. The country was founded by people fleeing from prosecution and suppression, and it's first war was fought against that same suppression trying to catch up. That mentality lies pretty deep in Americans, as I understand. It has nothing to do with cheating people into collecting our garbage and manning 24-hour convenience stores.<p>It's a shame that thankfulness to esp. US and UK troops isn't better founded in western European minds, and that it's only brought up when trying to justify a new war.

I have dealt with stock inventory for years and it is one of these areas that looks deceptively easy to implement but ends up being a lot more complex in real life.<p>The website makes many grand promises but there is very little information on what it actually does.   
The target customer should be someone knowledgeable in Stock Inventory, but there are not many specifics for them to even assess if the product is for them or not.<p>* Who does this target? small businesses? retail? factories?<p>* What is a &quot;sheet&quot; really ? It is a Form? a data entry grid?<p>* Inventory data doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, it needs to be fed to accounting software, so at least a good import&#x2F;export&#x2F;reporting story is important here.<p>* similarly, can I connect to the database to produce my own reports and plug custom software (even Excel for instance through a datasource) to it?<p>* I can&#x27;t find any information about cost management. Does the software only manage quantities or can it track cost as well?<p>* How does the software manage counting units? Can I manage cable lengths in metre or in whole roll? Can I sell some oil SKU by the litre and other by the bottle?<p>* What&#x27;s the story for annual&#x2F;continuous inventories (stock counts)? does it help me with that?<p>* Cant I easily make transfers from one warehouse to another?<p>* I can&#x27;t find whether the software is able to manage FIFO, LIFO, batches, etc.<p>* What&#x27;s the picking list story if there is one?<p>* Does the software manage part revisions? For instance factories may have different revisions of the same item (electronic or mechanical).<p>* Does the software manage stock locations so I can easily find where product with SKU F7786 is located?<p>* what&#x27;s the story for receiving deliveries? Can I have a quarantine area where I receive my goods for inspection?<p>It reads everywhere that this is a one-man labour of love.  
Why should I risk an important business activity to a one-man shop? What happens if the founder is sick and there&#x27;s a problem?<p>I don&#x27;t want to be too negative, I&#x27;m only being harsh because I really like the concept; the design and the amount of work put into this is a short time is amazing. The tablet story is great too.<p>On the other hand, it feels like this was made by a programmer who doesn&#x27;t really know the business he&#x27;s in and ends up with a products that seems to be targeting libraries and bookstores (2 very different businesses) and groceries, retailers, even factories maybe.  
It tries to be too much for too many.<p>To save this, I would target specific markets and make appropriate versions of the software for those markets, using their business terminology, highlighting on the first page the pain points they are facing and how the software solves them, etc.<p>Making a one product fits all is exactly the sort of problem small business face when they buy a cheap general purpose ERP: it&#x27;s often too complex and it ends up not being what they need.  
The pricing is also fairly high: a 4-seat version of Sage Line 100 (a complete ERP for SMB) costs less than US$900 per year in license renewal. Yours cost about $700 for 3 users only for inventory management. That&#x27;s quite a lot.",6033776,"{6037619,6036676,6036988,6037068,6037127}",,,,

Instant 24/7 booking feature or the b.) Call-to-confirm booking  feature, (owners preference) owners and property managers now have attractive home listing presentations that allow a renter to book directly off the page before they move on to another website.<p>Another well-thought-out feature is the ability for owners and property managers to quite easily post or link their unique listing page to vacation rental advertising sites like craigslist.<p>Scott Norris, founder of the company comments: ""Enhancing ReserveMyHome to an “All-in-One” for our owners and renters was a natural next step for our business, making the website a booking hub for private rental owners and property managers instead of a spoke-in-the-wheel advertising site.<p>Our expertise is booking vacation rentals for owners at a small commission. Most owners do not have the time to spend chasing inquiries all over town at all hours of the day and night, losing bookings, or having their home buried among hundreds of thousands of other rental listings.""<p>The loss of two bookings per month at $300 per night with a three-night stay amounts to a $21,600.00 annual loss. ReserveMyHome has changed that, without risk to these owners. Owners can sign up for FREE, log in to their unique webpage, block out days, change rates, make manual bookings, accept instant bookings, and easily promote their homes on sites like craigslist, facebook and Twitter with a click of a button.<p>Renters are also delighted that they have a safe alternative to booking private vacation rentals and no longer have to search through thousands of listings, and then endure the difficult process of contacting the owner, waiting for responses regarding availability, transferring funds to someone they don’t know and then waiting again for rental contracts and directions to the property.<p>Typically the booking process can take days and lots of time. Most of ReserveMyHome’s vacation rentals can be booked and confirmed in less than 5 minutes. This puts an end to a renter’s arduous quest to track down owners for availability and pricing. The rental logistics, including confirmations and driving directions, are all done automatically and instantly.<p>Zoe Avery, Co-founder nots, ""We are experiencing a high inquiry volume for our rentals especially in Lake Tahoe.

I think the fundamental underlying reason is that programming is difficult and so poorly understood.<p>A given: all software has bugs. Usually, that doesn&#x27;t matter — a CRUD app will eventually get debugged enough to the point of usability. (Sometimes even maintainability.) We do not understand enough about programming to guarantee perfect execution in all cases, but no one gains any value by causing an obscure input case to cause a null pointer exception.<p>Whenever we use crypto, however, we inherently have code which protects something valuable: from forum passwords to credit card numbers to state secrets. This means that all the subtleties which break in ordinary code, but no one cares about, suddenly become important. Every interaction of input to memory to processing to storage (to network) must be scrutinized for places where a crucial piece of data may leak an encryption key, or perhaps just enough known plaintext of known cyphertext to mount an attack.",6185166,,,,,

3785847,,comment,evoxed,2012-04-02 02:49:13,"All of these invented system carry their own pros and cons, but the aversion to ""junk associations"" is an extremely common misconception in my opinion (one that I held for quite a while as well). Many will argue that relative to your total cognitive power the cost is virtually zero but I don't think the discussion needs to go that way, and here's why: like anything, the beginner has to force everything. You put in the effort consciously because you recognize it as a step in some process. If the technique remains a novelty, then that's where you'll stay. Your associations may get ever more clever, simpler, faster, etc. But when you start to apply it constantly in your work and in everything else that you do, soon the technique simply fades into the background until at some point it might as well have disappeared. It's like math or spelling as a child, where you have to learn step by step what is and what isn't until it clicks, and then the why no longer matters. You add two numbers because that's the way it works– you don't have to convince yourself. As your memory progresses you the junk associations will fade out and stronger associations predominate, because they're relevant and you want to remember relevant things.<p>Edit: this is especially relevant to the ""read me a list and I'll repeat it forwards, backwards, or in any order you call out"" party trick.",3785079,,,,,

They make the process convoluted and confusing, hoping you'll give up. But don't give up (never give up!). Here's what you have to do:<p>- log in to GD and go to the domain manager. Go to each domain individually and check to see if the domain privacy proxy is turned on. If it is, it means that your whois info is being proxied by <a href=""http://domainsbyproxy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domainsbyproxy.com/</a> (it seems to be a sister site to GD).

You need to login to DBP and disable the proxy for all of your domains.<p>- Go back to GD and you'll notice the proxy is now off (magic!). You now need to unlock each domain and get an Authorization Code for each one by clicking the send Auth Code By Email link on the domain screen. Most (all?) registrars will request this when you initiate the transfer.<p>- Go to your new registrar and initiate the transfer (this is where you'll need the auth code).<p>- The new registrar will send an email to the administrative contact for the domain(s) confirming the start of the transfer. You may have to wait up to a day or so to get this.<p>- GD will send an email confirming the transfer is started. You can also check GD periodically because eventually they will display your domains as Transfer/Pending. Go to the My Domains page, mouse over the Domains tab and click pending transfers. Select all of your domains and click the ""Accept/Decline"" icon (it's a very confusing icon) and choose accept (obviously) and be sure to click all the Okays.<p>And you're done! If you use GoDaddy's DNS servers you may have to reconfigure your DNS and mail settings (maybe someone else has experience with that?).

2934373,,comment,nirvana,2011-08-28 18:19:25,"I've been starting businesses since I was a kid. It is like a hobby, or maybe an obsession.  I once started a business without realizing I had done so![1] Once I found the pleasure in selling, I just kept doing it.  Once I started having a positive income (e.g.: bringing in more money than I needed to live well) I started investing. I've been investing for a couple decades, it also is a hobby.  For the past four years I've been a full time nomad-- working on a startup and traveling full time, living out of a backpack.  I have built  a half dozen successful businesses, and worked for two dozen startups. I've spent a fair bit of time learning about these subjects and would be happy to share my experiences.  I too would like to find a site like this.<p>The thing is, when you've become successful to some degree, inevitably, your perspective changes.  The perspective of those who've achieved some success is very different from those who want to achieve success but haven't, yet.<p>I don't mean this in an elitist way-- there's nothing I'd like more than to share what I've learned with people who are in the position I was when I was starting out.<p>Unfortunately, Hacker News is not that place.  When I've broached such subjects, the responses have not been of the ""I'm interested in learning your perspective"" variety, more of the ""I'm going to tell you that you're wrong because authority X told me so.""<p>I'm trying to come up with some examples that won't obviously and immediately offend people.  But, for instance, talking about how you can invest yourself (one of the OP's topics) often is met with ""you'd be better off buying index funds"" responses.   It doesn't matter that I've been investing myself and getting outsized returns, and found that it really isn't that hard, and I'd love to share the techniques-- the dominant perspective is that individuals cannot beat the market.   Or, if you talk about tax mitigation, the response is often along the lines of ""you shouldn't do that, you owe it to society"".  Or if you attempt to explaining what's going on in economic terms but your perspective disagrees with the popular mainstream one (which is keynesianism, or more accurately, krugmanism) you're met with often derisive responses.   You know, if economics is a science, it should be able to predict things...and good economists predicted the housing bubble. Even Ron Paul was caught on video in 2001 predicting it.<p>Anyway, one of the big lessons of business that I've learned, is that economics is important. Perspective is important.  Learning about business, and becoming successful really is about changing your perspective.<p>Unfortunately, due to the organization of this site (stories disappear quickly, detailed discussions are a bit difficult) and the culture, it is hard to share a perspective that disagrees with the majority one.<p>I once was told my company was not a real startup, but that it was a ""lifestyle business"".... this from someone that, near as I could tell, had never started a business.  Hell, even if it is a lifestyle business... it gave me a fantastic lifestyle!   I don't feel that people here on HN want to learn from those who have had success... and as much success as I <i>have</i> had, I really want to learn from those who have had <i>MORE</i>.<p>HN is the closest I've found, for all the seemingly negative things I'm saying about it.... I wish there were a way to change it so that we could share these things.<p>But if HN is too big of a ship, then I'd be keen to hang out in a private forum.  Really, get just a dozen good people there- people who have started businesses and are not ashamed of being capitalists-- and you can have some great discussion.<p>[1] I was importing tools from china, and because I didn't know their quality, and the price was so low, I tended to buy 2 or 4 of everything figuring they might break.  The quality was actually good, so I'd sell the extras, but then without realizing it I started buying more and more every order.  I found that keeping four drills around was convenient, as I'd just keep different bits in each one and witch tools, but the next time I ordered, I ordered 4 more drills and then sold them, then ordered 8 extra drills and sold them as well.  Same thing with bit sets, and other tools. I was making great markups on the tools, but when I realized what I was doing I stopped because it wasn't really scalable.",2934103,"{2934429,2934791,2934564,2934561,2934424}",,,,

2934377,,comment,viscanti,2011-08-28 18:20:30,"I agree that the idea that ""customers hold all the answers"" is flawed, but that's not what customer development is.  A better phrase would be ""no answers are found inside the building"".  You can't just ask people what they need and build it, that's not customer development.  Customer development is about finding a problem worth solving and that people are willing to pay for.  You need to understand the problem thoroughly, and that requires you to get out of the building and talk to lots of people.  If the solution was obvious, and the people you talked to told you what to build, then you wouldn't have much of a business, because the problem would be easy to solve (and someone would have solved it, or they'd do it in house).<p>Customers don't hold all the answers, but they can point you to the right solution.  You still need to come up with an optimal solution.  Once you reach product-market fit, then you can work on optimizing customer acquisition.  Before product-market fit, you don't know what your product really is or who your customers really are.  Any time spent optimizing that is time that could be better spent finding the actual problem and getting to product-market fit.  At best you risk wasting time, at worst you risk following the wrong path because you've invested so much time optimizing it, which would make pivoting to the ""right"" product/market much more difficult.",2932913,,,,,

interpretation is different.<p>Like you say, the genius of Apple and Jobs is an incredible focus on
the simplicity and intuitiveness of their products. I have seen two
year old kids able to use ipads. This was their innovation and it has
won them millions (billions?) of loyal fans.<p>This was so radically different than the prevailing ethos in the tech
industry at the time that their supporters feel they should be
protected or rewarded for changing the industry.<p>However, there is a problem in granting protection for these types of
innovations, in that we are setting a dangerous precedent for patents
and innovation. The individual user interface elements that make up
the iPhone, by themselves, are all relatively obvious. Swiping to turn
a page is the natural evolution of the book. Movies like Minority
Report suggest the range of gestures we can imagine given the
appropriate technology. It's quite a stretch to suggest that something
so similar to what we have done all our lives should be protected by
law and in effect create a protected monoply and prevent others from
using these ideas in their products.<p>Instead those that admire Apple and what they have done should
continue to do what they have been doing, buy their
products.<p>As someone who has owned multiple ipads, ipods, iphones, and mac
books, I know how compelling their products are and the loyalty it
breeds in their users. Therefore, I think it is unlikely that many
will step back and think whether this really is the best result for
our industry.",4435981,{4436964},,,,

You can simply create a new architecture target for GCC in a different environment (for example, Linux), and compile GCC with your new environment as a target architecture on Linux. You then install this brand new compiler on your brand new OS, et voila: you skipped the nasty bit and have a working compiler for your new OS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)</a>",4985834,"{4987478,4986976,4988546,4986126}",,,,

4736405,,comment,wyuenho,2012-11-03 11:30:35,"The problem is not callback, the problem is that callbacks exists in Javascript.<p>Callbacks themselves, when used wisely, can often enhance code readability, hell LISP has had function references since forever, but I think the most complain about callbacks are actually complains about callbacks in noisy languages, mostly likely languages with noisy syntaxes like Javascript and Java. When read that way, the disgust towards callbacks do seem to have merits. As the author has pointed out, the 2 getPhoto() functions at the end  express and do exactly the same things, but obviously the CoffeeScript version reads better.<p>Callbacks have been around a long time and I've never heard of people complain as much about them as people have for Javascript and I conjecture the reasons are as follows:<p>1) There's no named parameters (keyword arguments) in Javascript, so people pass around objects literals into functions to emulate them.
2) Making lambdas in JS is too easy, but the syntax is too noisy.
3) Oh so many aliasing of <i>this</i>;
4) Self-chainable JS libraries like jQuery makes the style of calling multiple functions too easy. But lines can only go to long before becoming unwieldy, so people tend to indent chained method calls multiple times.
5) No modules and global namespace pollution is frown upon, so people are hesitant to flatten deeply nested callback chains.
6) There are a dozen ways to make a JS class and/or object depending on frameworks, and they are not at all compatible.<p>All of these ""features"" coagulate in JS into giant blobs of snot like this:<p><pre><code>  &#60;script&#62;
    $(document).ready(function() {
      var $main = $(""#main"");
      $main.
        hide().
        click(function(e) {
          $.ajax({
            type: ""POST"",
            dataType: ""json"",
            contentType: ""application/json"",
            success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
               data['rows'].forEach(function(line) {
                   $main.append($(""&#60;p&#62;"", {
                      className: ""row""

You have to be willing to give it up. At the expense of sounding cliched, the only price to pay for happiness, is your unhappiness/misery and for many, its a huge price.

Let me explain…<p>Essentially what I do is spec out the project very specifically and have local people write the front end.  Then we outsource the backend and have interns use the locally built frontend to thoroughly test the backend delivered from the outsourced company.<p>This isn’t dramatically cheaper since you have to spec the thing locally and pay interns to test it while still paying the outsourced developers (it only saves about $2.65 an hour by my calculations).  But it does have advantages in that it allows us to be more flexible with our schedule (we can employ more or less outsourced workers as needed) and it does make for a happier development environment (allowing local developers to focus on the relatively more fun front end development and less on the nuts and bolts backend stuff)<p>So in the end I feel it’s successful though again not so much in the financial sense.,1485584,{1485972},,,,

However, I look at the experience very differently.<p>They seek candidates with strong engineering skills, and only do a little culture fit at interview time (this was my experience at least). The real culture fit test happens during bootcamp, where they try for 6 weeks to break any misfit. Now that isn't going to work for everyone, but their strategy is to go all-out and try get a strong candidate to work well in their culture.<p>It didn't work out for me. I constantly reflect on what made me decide to accept their offer, what I could have discovered that would have made me realise it wasn't going to work out for me. I take interviewing far more as a two-way discussion, trying to find out what a company sees in me that they like and sometimes I tell them they misread me rather than risk ending up in the same predicament.<p>There are a number of things not directly in my control that lead to me leaving though. I had some bad luck with many of my bootcamp tasks, e.g. task owner on vacation for a couple weeks, task owners not being responsive if I didn't get back to them with working code really fast (I was working on other tasks at the same time), etc. I was drawn in very strongly by a manager who recognised that my skills strongly matched his team's requirements. I felt uncomfortable around that team from day one and never really tried hard on their tasks, and that reflected very poorly on me. At the same time, teams I took the initiative to approach would setup an initial meeting and then I'd never hear back from them. It wanted to dig into stuff I was excited about, while my bootcamp manager wanted me to complete the boring tasks I was assigned. Other things at hackathons drew me in, and I spent too much time on those projects only to be told a week before being fired that those were not being counted in my evaluation so I had to scramble to work again with the team I didn't get along with. Soon after that, that team didn't want to give me new tasks and I was left with nothing.<p>If I was to go through the process again, there are a few things I'd do differently. I would avoid letting the side hackathon projects take up too much time in the early days until I was firmly settled in. I would get more clarification on tasks as early on as possible. I would focus on one or two tasks at a time, rather than trying to churn through five or six in parallel. This way turn around time with task owners would be faster making them happier to help. I would forget about looking for a team until week four at the earliest - focus on tasks instead. I wouldn't take their advice to pick any team, even if you had no experience in the area, too strongly. It's good to get a strong start, and take the other roads once you've proven yourself.<p>I found a new job within a month. As an H1-B holder, I needed to be quick, so I settled for what I could get. Companies reacted differently to me being fired. While I'm sure all of them take it as a negative, some seemed to sympathise. I'm now interviewing again, and depending on whether Facebook comes up I have told some companies what happened and not told others. It doesn't seem to make a huge difference, since I've proven myself at my current company, but some keep prodding to try find that fatal flaw in me that lead to the firing (which I don't believe exists). I'm considering removing Facebook entirely from my CV after my next job.",5784758,"{5785156,5785129,5789697}",,,,

It was, uh, not exactly an experience full of female role models.  The 'fewer than one in ten' ratio may be true of startups in general, but the way to balance out the gender divide is to provide more role models, not to magnify the status quo: I was pretty unhappy to see such an exclusionist panel.<p>In general, if I were a woman, I would have felt pretty unwelcome at the event, in general: of my small amount of wandering around during the breaks, I saw one attendee wearing a shirt with the text: ""SELECT * FROM girls WHERE free_sex=TRUE;"".  More distressingly, I saw a speaker (Ben Horowitz [1]) wearing a shirt with the text ""No bitch-ass-ness"" on it; I suspect that this may have been a cultural reference that I missed, but that sure does seem as unwelcoming as a shirt that would say 'man up and do it' might.<p>The content was, in general, high quality.

5636283,,comment,_nxnx,2013-05-01 04:24:32,"While I agree with most of what you say, the problem is that a lot of studies have been done on the HPA axis and cortisol in CFS/burnout, but there is no agreement. Some studies find low cortisol, others don't. There is definitely HPA axis dysfunction, but nobody can seem to pin it down. I suspect that if you measured cortisol throughout the day and correlated it to a symptom diary and/or a stress test, you might be able to come up with a diagnostic test.<p>The other issue is that there is no cheap and easy cortisol test like there is for blood glucose. As far as I can tell it would be possible to develop such a test, but nobody has done it yet for a number of reasons (lack of demand, cost, FDA approval, etc).<p>If someone were to [1] figure out a definitive test for burnout/CFS and [2] develop/patent a home testing kit they would be very rich and help a lot of people into the bargain.<p>As for Teitelbaum: while he does have some useful stuff to say, he also peddles a lot of quackery.",5635993,{5636524},,,,

Test scores here are mediocre at best, to the point that most families with the means to do so move out to the suburbs once they have kids.<p>There are a wide variety of reasons for this phenomenon, and they'll vary depending on who you ask (urban schools are generally expensive to run, special-needs students are disproportionately expensive to educate, teachers' unions have a lot of clout, etc.).",4334089,,,,,

4334998,,comment,kevinalexbrown,2012-08-03 18:19:50,"What strikes me as interesting regarding Google's automated approach to community regulation is the effect of focusing on action rather than intent. Making a perfect intent-detector is difficult: much easier to make an action-detector and penalize actions consistent with malicious behavior. This works as long as those actions are a) necessary for malicious behavior and b) are easy to avoid while making good apps.<p>The experiment is now: how much developers will adjust their behavior to <i>signal</i> clean behavior versus Google perfecting its algorithm to perfectly judge intent. Once Google has a reasonable policy in place, they can sit and wait for developers to conform, and presumably those that can't conform cannot do so precisely because the behavior they would have to change is the behavior that makes their software malicious or undesirable.<p>Humans already do this every day in conversation - I adjust my language and tone to signal non-malicious intent when making a statement I fear might be perceived as threatening or rude. But these are relatively easy fixes that do not affect my communication horribly; I suppose it's still an open question as to whether Google's criteria unreasonably hinder the development process.",4333542,"{4335256,4335194}",,,,

My problem is that I get excited about something initially but that excitement fades over time especially when I get to the point where I have to do something hard and/or not fun.<p>So generally I'll try to do one of two things:<p>1) Find a partner. I find it a lot easier to get going and a lot harder to quit when there's someone else going through it with you; sort of like going to the gym...<p>2) Pick an idea that still excites me even after sitting in my list for a while. If I'm going to go it alone, whatever it is has to be important enough to me that I still care after that initial honeymoon. This time is really valuable to me personally. I find that in the beginning I focus on potential but given some time I'll eventually come back to earth and think more about what needs to be done, all the steps, and potential roadblocks. After all that, if I'm still excited to tackle the problem, I have at least some confidence that I'll have the conviction to push through the hard times.<p>Fair warning, my current list is long and the number completed is still zero (abandoned projects is also zero). I have just started working on something recently though, so there is some hope. I guess this is really a long winded way of saying try to find something that you're really passionate about, don't waste time on things you aren't, and don't get discouraged if you haven't found it yet.",4884788,,,,,

It also betrays the underlying assumption that men and women are two completely different species that live in completely separate worlds. Throughout the article that assumption is never challenged.<p>&#62; <i>The male brain has the enviable ability to essentially switch off emotions when desired — in part because it’s hard for a man to think clearly in the face of emotion.</i><p>Big news: everybody does that, no matter what gender they are. It's called compartmentalization, without it people would not be able to function. Emotional reactions and analysis are pushed off to a future point in time whenever more pressing concerns are at hand. That's a basic mental triage technique and everybody can do it. There are also many people who _never_ do it, and in my experience there was no significant gender difference to that behavior.<p>&#62; <i>When men see a worker taking criticism personally, seeming to push too hard for his or her ideas, or having a  personality conflict, they automatically view that worker as less business-savvy and less experienced, or as someone who operates on emotion, not logic.</i><p>Paragraphs like this make excellent statements for people who like evolutionary psychology, but they're simply not rooted in fact. In my experience, most ""Type A"" personalities who do like to dish out harsh personal criticism like it's a bodily function simply cannot take the same when it is directed at them. Likewise, the perception of business-savvyness is probably always linked to the perception of sameness: successful businesspeople attribute superior skills to people whom they perceive as similar to their own personality. And again, I observed no significant difference between sexes here. Regarding the unspoken assumption of public displays of male toughness: I've seen tough jock-types sitting under their desks crying just because someone had looked at them funny.<p>&#62; <i>The science is clear, for example, that although the female brain isn’t designed to compartmentalize personal feelings the same way a man’s brain does, a woman can — if she chooses — force a calm demeanor when she is starting to feel defensive.</i><p>That's a lie. This statement has nothing to do with science.<p>All in all this article is a standard set of misleading statements, ""obvious"" assumptions and outright lies.

You'd be wise to listen to them.<p>And in the spirit of offering advice, here's my two cents: read ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"" and actually follow the advice. If that's too much, then just call or email 100 potential customers, outline your idea, and ask them what they think. These should be real potential customers who you envision would really want your service, not friends who once sold a piece of furniture on Craigslist. I can tell that you've got some emotional attachment to your idea, so this step might be hard, because you could find after 10 or 20 calls that things aren't quite the same from your customer's experience as you thought. But just keep going. By the time you have talked to 100 potential customers, you'll know exactly what they need, what they don't need, how they find new products, how to market to them, etc.<p>Good luck, and please do keep us posted with your progress :)",1434602,{1434770},,,,

1635819,,comment,CWuestefeld,2010-08-26 14:16:37,"<i>European societies sacrifice a bit of growth potential and individual freedom to get better living conditions for all.</i><p>Economists can tell you that this can't scale up to the whole world. Paul Graham's article explains it very well. (The following is all quotation; I'm not italicizing, in the interest of readability)<p>If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving the overall standard of living, it's not enough just to raise up the poor. What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious and goes on to become another Bill Gates? Economic inequality will be as bad as ever. If you actually want to compress the gap between rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing up on the bottom.<p>How do you push down on the top? You could try to decrease the productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to overeat, and so on. But this approach is hard to implement. The only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can, and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge) to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.<p>...<p>At a minimum, we'd have to accept lower rates of technological growth. If you believe that large, established companies could somehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, the ball is in your court to explain how. (If you can come up with a remotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing business books and consulting for large companies.)<p>Ok, so we get slower growth. Is that so bad? Well, one reason it's bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to slow down with us. If you're content to develop new technologies at a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that you don't invent anything at all. Anything you might discover has already been invented elsewhere. And the only thing you can offer in return is raw materials and cheap labor. Once you sink that low, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install puppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women as prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory-- all the things we do to poor countries now. The only defense is to isolate yourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century. But the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce it.<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html</a>",1635494,{1635915},,,,

Admittedly it wasn't initially what we would expect from a democracy but access improved over time. When America was founded the version of democracy was undoubtedly a significant improvement but it would have been influenced by the British model.<p>Over time other nations have created arguably better versions (proportional representation for example) and of course the US and Britain have improved their system as well by allowing more people to vote.<p>Have a look at The Economist 'Democracy Index' you'll see that the US currently ranks 17th of all countries <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index</a>.<p>I personally believe the Parliamentary system originated in the UK is more robust than the US's presidential system.

The only choice is Rep, Dem or waste your vote. This effectively denies genuine representation to people who's views are different from those a both parties.

He is a senior VP of derivatives trading at another Wall Street firm, albeit a much smaller one than GS, so weight as you feel appropriate.<p><i>Goldman will settle the civil suit. The SEC has them bang to rights on Rule 10b-5 violations, and anyone familiar with securities regulations knows this. They will claim that they are going to settle because it's in their shareholders' interests.<p>They've been trying to spin this by saying that they're market-makers. The WSJ had an editorial on Wednesday arguing this (probably assisted in the writing by GS), the execs said as much in Washington, and a friend of mine who works there, probably repeating an internal memo, made the same argument. It goes like this - if you buy GE stock and it goes down, you can't sue the NYSE or the broker.<p>The reason it's crap is that there is a huge difference, both conceptually and from a regulatory standpoint, between origination/new issues/primary market on the one hand, and secondary market trading on the other. GS are arguing as though the former is part of the latter. It isn't.</i>",1334799,,,,,

Trademark abuse is not unheard of, but if anything we technologists grossly overestimate how often it actually happens because we've seen domain names getting ""stolen"", for various values of stolen, by claiming trademark ownership over domain names. (And for that matter, much of the ""trademark abuse"" is <i>really</i> ICANN abuse rather than trademark abuse, it's really ICANN's decision. If they take the domain name because of a bribe or even ""just because"", you still wouldn't be able to do much.) But it's actually an importan aspect of the law, and even if you're of a mind to throw out patents and copyright entirely, you really need to stop and think some more about throwing out trademarks. What a trademark boils down to is a mark that allows you to identify when you are dealing with an entity. Trademark violation is when you mark yourself in such a way as to cause people to confuse who you are. There's hardly a model of society I can think of from the rabid left to the rabid right and all the things that don't fit on that scale where it's actually <i>desirable</i> to let entities falsely masquerade as other entities. Most of them are actually so deeply built on being able to identify the people you are dealing with that you can't hardly even see it any more, it's just part of the background fabric.<p>And yes, Lamebook and Facebook are very confusable. Don't ask your tech savvy friends, just take a picture of the two websites, go somewhere that isn't a tech hub, stop ten people on the street, and ask them if these sites look like they are from the same company. You'll get your answer pretty quickly, I think. Companies spin off subbrands all the time.<p>(And read the link carefully for <i>what it says</i>, not what you think you can twist it into if you read certain words in certain ways. Remember, your arguments don't have to convince me, or convince some pathologically stupid AI, they have to convince a <i>human judge</i>, who has spent the past twenty years listening to people trying to twist and bend the text of the law in their favor.)",1935695,{1936194},,,,

1035691,,comment,Perceval,2010-01-06 20:41:59,"I think that you've identified an important problem, but I disagree with your approach to solving it.  I think you're right that scarcity is a good way to make voting (especially approval-style voting) into something more meaningful.<p>One of the problems with Digg is not just the unlimited amount of voting that one can do, but also the unlimited amount of submitting one can do.  As a result, you have people running scripts to submit tons and tons of articles scraped from RSS feeds.  Literally one article every few seconds.  What your system would do (making people earn mod points through submissions) is simply encourage users to submit as much as possible in order to gain more points.  Crapflooding the queue then destroys the signal to noise ration irretrievably.<p>I think the better way to implement scarcity, apart from your method and Slashdot's method, is to weight users' votes according to the number of votes they've distributed in a given period (say 24 hours).  So a person who votes for under 10 things might have each vote count as a full 1 point.  But a person who votes for 20 things might have their vote count as only 1/2 a point.  You might put a lower bound on it, so that a vote will never be worth less than 1/10th of a point, but you get the idea.<p>It's not scarcity by number, so much as scarcity by dilution.  The best part of this is that it's invisible to the user.  When you have a system that's visible (""You've got 5 Modpoints, Use 'em or Lose 'em!""), you encourage gaming the system.  When you have a system that's invisible, users can behave normally or badly and the system can compensate without giving them clues as to how to game it.",1035328,,,,,

Some of the candidates we interview these days are a symptom of this very problem. Lemme give you 2 examples ( actual interviews questions we asked candidates ).<p>1. write a function that returns the sum of the first one thousand odd numbers.<p>Expected Answer:<p>function foo() {<p><pre><code>  return 1000*1000;
</code></pre>
}<p>The candidate's answer :<p>function foo() {<p><pre><code>  sum = 0;

  count = 0;

  i=0;

  while(true) {

    i++;

    if (i%2==1) {

        count++;

        sum += i;

    }

    if( count == 1000 ) {

      return sum;

    }

  }
</code></pre>
}<p>Now, the candidate is a LAMP expert and can do magic with linux sys-admin tools, but really, this is such an incredibly lame solution. Yes, its ""correct"" and very clear and nobody will get confused looking at his solution. But what's more clear is that this person has never had a single course in discrete math. Sum of n odd numbers is n^2 is taught on day 1, its so fundamental and basic and even if you forget the actual result, it takes just 5 minutes to derive it from first principles ( just write the sum forwards to backwards, then write it again backwards to forwards, then add the two expressions, hey voila there you go! ). When we show him the expected solution, he is genuinely surprised and says we've pulled a fast one on him. ""Its a trick question! "". He says he's never been taught anything like this in the classroom. That's just sad.<p>2. Find all the integer triples that form right triangles whose smallest side is less than a million.<p>Candidate's answer :<p>for i from 1 to 1000000 {<p>for j from 1 to 1000000 {<p>for k from 1 to 2000000 {<p><pre><code>  if i*i + j*j == k*k then print i,j,k;
</code></pre>
}<p>}<p>}<p>Again, this is the ""correct"" solution and its eminently readable, but it is supremely inefficient and super-lame. Its like the candidate has never given any thought to the actual problem, and is just throwing loops and conditionals at it. I will refrain from giving the expected solution here, but any student of discrete math can generate pythagorean triplets in a much more efficient manner than the lame solution given above.<p>A little dose of Knuth's Concrete Math goes a very long way.",2833669,"{2834985,2835952}",,,,

Well, here's one thing: The instant anyone in those countries discovers what you're doing, I expect one of two things will happen. Either (1) they will completely stop accepting your aid, in which case whatever good you were hoping it would do is right out of the window, or (2) you will suddenly find a whole lot more terrorists looking to do a lot of damage in rich countries.<p>More simply, you might just like to imagine how you'd feel if the roles were reversed. So, e.g., let's suppose that the Chinese government said: ""All these Westerners are relying on our services to make lots of super-cheap goods. Why don't we put something in the plastic that makes them less fertile? It's for their own good."" And let's suppose that you have been trying to have children for a few years and failing (or some close friend or relation has been) when you discover this. How do you feel?<p>A few other obvious things that I hope you missed: (1) Different people are fertile to different extents, and if you lower the average fertility you're most likely making lots of people completely infertile. (2) Your measures are going to affect the extra-specially poor disproportionately. To make a whole country's <i>average</i> fertility go down to replacement level, it may have to reduce the fertility of those people much more drastically. Down to zero, perhaps. (3) Having children is really, <i>really</i> important to a lot of people. You may think that's irrational; you may even be right; but that's how it is, and that's why you'd most likely get the effects I described above. (4) Having to make a choice between two horrible alternatives -- e.g., starving versus sterilization (see #2 for why it might really be pretty much exactly that choice) is, for many people, substantially <i>worse</i> than the better of those two alternatives.

784477,,comment,derefr,2009-08-25 09:46:49,"The world can't sustain a population coverage similar to that of NYC or HK. Those population centers are supported by millions of acres of farmland that grow the food they eat. If there are <i>enough</i> people, then we don't run out of <i>living space</i> for them... but we <i>do</i> run out of farmland.<p>Secondly, population will peak because of the very factor I mentioned—people in <i>industrial</i> societies are too <i>busy</i> to have kids. However, one important fact about industrial societies is that they constantly seek to improve themselves and gain efficiency. More automation means more people out of work (or consumerism-for-the-sake-of-feeding-the-cycle, but I'm supposing we ignore that option.) Take this to its limit, and no one works (except on creative pursuits, but that won't be <i>everyone</i>.) What do you suppose the rest spend their time doing? I'm thinking population will start shooting <i>straight</i> back up in a post-industrial society. Not because each couple has <i>more</i> kids, but because there are <i>more</i> couples, well, coupling.<p>You haven't explained to me yet what's wrong with sterilization in-and-of-itself; you're using it like Americans tend to use the word ""socialist,"" assuming that it's scary without explaining precisely <i>why</i> it's scary. Couples can still have kids under this scheme. Couples can still have <i>just as many</i> kids. It would just take, say, ten times as long for a couple to conceive (the regular period being a month), meaning that there would be a nine-month ""fallow"" period between pregnancies. Each couple could have the same number of kids, but half the children would end up in the following generational cohort, meaning that the yearly <i>growth rate</i> would be halved. Since conception is harder, some couples would give up after a smaller number of children, lowering the total produced. This is, in the end, a much more lax scheme than even China's one-child rule.<p>I can see where you are coming from in that developing counties need to have their oppression lifted in order to stop ""investing in the future"" with overproduction of children. However, consider this: if you do kill off the warlords, and ensure that all the infant mortality goes away, but leave behind a <i>current</i> population far exceeding their own supply of resources, what will happen to that generation, and the few proceeding from it, before they reach the point where the cultural tradition of overproducing young gives way to an industrial lifestyle? Assuming the resources go unequally distributed, won't those still in poverty try to take those resources by force, and become new warlords? War and anarchy will break out wherever population greatly exceeds resources, and there is no infrastructure (e.g. police) to hold down an oppressive government from forming.<p>To beat tyranny, the population must sharply drop, or the resources must greatly rise, along with the removal of the government, or the attractor won't be escaped. Food genetically modified to lower fertility does both. It might not be the best solution, but it's <i>a</i> solution, and unlike most others, it's one that's impossible to screw up. Contraceptives can be discarded for religious or cultural reasons, but food must be eaten. Educators' teachings can be ignored as misguided, but your body's egg or sperm count is a cold, hard fact. Other resources given as aid can be confiscated by a warlord for their value (OLPC laptops, anyone?), but what value does food that lowers your virility have to a warlord that could just as well eat something else?<p>I'm not suggesting there isn't a better, social solution.

Every group of people that consistently does something has a system for it.
while in programming a system is denoted by strict rules, in human interaction it's based on incentives (including social incentives).
So, you can get somebody to do something if it strokes with his incentive or you can try to subvert the incentives.<p>It's not by definition an immoral thing to do.
e.g. a real-estate broker wants to sell a house as quickly as possible, so they tend to sell houses slightly below market-value and then convince you it's the best you'll get.
you can rig this incentive in your favor by telling the broker you've contacted two brokers and will accept the highest bid.<p>I actually applied this one recently as my sister was looking for a renter and had contacted only 1 broker.

Perhaps there is only a right to pursue profit by live performance. But what happens if <i>that</i> becomes copyable? We already have at least one instance of a holographic singer (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku</a>). What if holographic recorders and projectors become as cheap as cameras and microphones and screens and speakers? Live performance could be copied about as effectively as live sound is now (recorded music is not a perfect reproduction of what was played in studio or on stage). What then?<p>Is there no right to pursue profit by live performance either? Decreasing costs of production seem likely to make copying merchandise reasonably possible (you can already just draw a design and have someone print a T-shirt or such for you). So is there no right to pursue profit by merchandise either?<p>If there is no right to pursue profit by distribution, live performance, or merchandise, I think it is safe to say there is no right to pursue profit at all.

We all like our i-things, so why aren't we paying people to develop them? Why is Apple's cheapest product $129, and the cheapest Kickstarter level usually $1? Why won't we pay $129 for Kickstarter projects that sound interesting to us if pay-what-you-will really works?<p>Similarly, the most advanced synthesizers, digital mixers, even music software are all produced to be sold.

  Manager: Nothing.  Can't be done.
  Me:      What if we added systems testing to unit testing?
  Me:      And then built rigorous test plans covering almost everything?
  Me:      And then enforced User Acceptance Testing?
  Me:      And allowed nothing into production without passing?
  Me:      Would it be better?
  Manager: Yes, but we can't afford to do all of that.
  Me:      So, bug-free software isn't impossible, just expensive?
  Manager: No, it's impossible.  Get back to work.
  Me:      Sigh.
  
  Manager: A web app is impossible.
  Me:      Why?
  Manager: Because it depends upon data entered by regular people.
  Me:      So?
  Manager: People are idiots.  They enter wrong data all the time.
  Me:      What if we trained them?
  Manager: Impossible.  They don't work for us.
  Me:      What if we made the software smarter?
  Manager: What do you mean?
  Me:      Data validation.
  Me:      Data reasonableness based upon rules or history.
  Me:      Crowdsourcing data validation.
  Manager: The data would still be bad.
  Me:      What would it take to make the data good?
  Manager: Nothing. Impossible.

SF has the unfortunate confluence of very limited land, desirable living conditions that drive real estate prices sky-high, a core of super-wealthy people willing to pay those prices and more, and a culture of ""hip-poverty"" (think hippies and the kids you see today hanging out in Lower Haight) that lends itself to a more relaxed attitude towards the poor.  Unlike cities with more land, there really is nowhere for people to go... just as you can't leave homeless on the street, you can't put them out on a raft in the bay.  And buying the land for shelters is likely prohibitively expensive.<p>It's a homeless situation that I think is a little more complex than many other big cities face, and I don't know what the right answer to it is.  But if people truly have no other place to go than the Civic Center sidewalks, I'd let them lie there for want of a better solution myself, just because the situation in SF is so particular.<p>Anyway, just kind of musing out loud.",2285712,{2285843},,,,

2236019,,comment,f1gm3nt,2011-02-18 16:25:04,"I've been working with php for about 10 years now. I have to say that I really enjoy frameworks. They make my job a lot easier. Before I started using frameworks I already built one of my own without realizing it.<p>To start off with I had my own classes to make tasks a little easier. Most php applications deal with a database of some sort, because of that I created a database class that helped me connect to a database and get the information I need. Same with templates. I used smarty since I didn't see a need in making my own. I had my own directory structure and config files for everything. When I was working on a site that needed something was usually when my 'framework' got updated.<p>Then I started reading about frameworks. I have used most frameworks in one way or another. The one that I prefer over other php frameworks is symfony (symfony-project.com). Why? They use doctrine as an ORM. They already have best practices built in. It's not as 'bloated' as other frameworks. Take CodeIgniter for example. Then go take a look at Kohana (which is a stripped down version of it). Once version 2 comes out they will have PHPUnit bundled with it. They use existing open source software instead of reinventing the wheel and making one for that framework only.<p>What is the benefit to you as a php programmer to use a php framework? There are a lot of things to take into consideration when creating a web application such as security. Are you escaping user input before you use that input in a MySQL query? What about user session management? There is more to consider, but hopefully you should get the idea. You start to see yourself repeating the same code after awhile so you start making classes or functions that make your job easier.<p>Should you use php without a framework? You can, but you will essential be creating your own after awhile. IMO it's best just to research a few different ones and find the one that best suits your needs since you can leave the framework development to other guys while you focus on creating a site. For me, symfony best fits my needs. Others may want to check out CakePHP or other frameworks. I never cared for Zend Framework, but use the zend library.",2235507,,,,,

With the constant innovation in web apps and user demand for a more feature-rich experience, that's an uphill battle for a distributed system.""<p>That's backwards. In a distributed system there's competition between nodes because it's relatively easy for a user to move from one node to another. In a centralized system the competition is with separate systems, and since it's harder to move away an entrenched central system doesn't need to do much to survive.<p>Individual nodes also don't need to be as conservative about new features as massive centralized systems do.<p>There is a point where inertia sets in and new features that require widespread adoption become impossible (this is where email and IRC are now), but that takes years.",235206,,,,,

1386233,,comment,kevinelliott,2010-05-28 13:49:00,"To entertain your reasoning: Adobe certainly could have intentionally created a ""sucky native app"" to contrast their ""awesome Adobe iPhone OS compiler"" but they mostly left out features and released a bloated (size) app. If they truly made a native app with HTML-based text and image optimization, or use their compiler, they could have equally reduced the size of this app and increased the functionality beyond what they have done here. Thus, the current implementation does NOT do a good job of proving that their compiler could have been better than a native Objective-C app.<p>Even so, if Adobe did want to throw a laughing cog at Apple via their clients, they're doing Wired a disservice, and frankly, that's terribly insane. They just couldn't throw a high profile partner/client under the bridge just to amuse some tantric executive war between Adobe and Apple.<p>Lastly, although hard to believe a company fairly technology agnostic as Wired would use their financial line (their money making product) as a way to experiment with dissing a technology giant, let's pretend Wired and Adobe both wanted to stick it to Apple for the 3.1.3 clause. They would be simply shooting themselves in the foot, as their customer is who really loses out here, not Apple.<p>It just make any sense at all, although I will give you that it's a romantic idea. More likely, they rushed a replacement implementation, since they couldn't use Adobe's compiler. Conde Naste clearly upholds Wired to the same deadlines as their other high end properties, and want to see a ROI for all the R&#38;D they've had, perhaps.

285611,,comment,sofal,2008-08-25 04:14:09,"It does get pretty silly sometimes. There are only a few things that are ""outlawed"", and therefore people think that as long as they abstain from those substances, they're in total compliance with what their religion expects of them. The root reason of the dietary restrictions is a principle of respecting the body and keeping it clean, but people misapply it by interpreting it verbatim and then gorging themselves on junk food, soda, or anything that isn't healthy but isn't technically ""forbidden"".<p>I think it's a good thing that the church doesn't forcefully regulate which sodas we can or cannot drink, because that would be controlling and ridiculous. However, these slightly arbitrary rules can end up encouraging a group of people who do the minimum required just to remain in good social status. That will be the case anywhere.<p>Another example of this is R-rated movies. There was a church leader a long time ago who at one time at a general conference warned against viewing R-rated movies. This seems perfectly acceptable, except that it ended up creating an unwritten rule of sorts among LDS members. The principle is that we should avoid movies that don't meet the standards we're expected to have, but it inevitably created a group of people who were perfectly okay with seeing any movie regardless of the content as long as the MPAA didn't put the magic 'R' on it.<p>It's hard to know where to draw the line when you know that some people are just going to get as close to that line as possible. You just hope that most people are listening to the underlying principles rather than the base requirements.<p>I occasionally drink caffeinated sodas if there isn't anything else available. I don't consider this to be especially damaging to my health.

That's not to say this conversions aren't a source of issues, just that I don't see any show-stopper problems currently in Node, V8, or JavaScript.<p>In JavaScript, a string is a series of UTF-16 code units, so the smiley face is written '\ud83d\ude04'.  This string has length 2, not 1, and behaves like a length-2 string as far as regexes, etc., which is too bad.  But even though you don't get the character-counting APIs you might want, the JavaScript engine knows this is a surrogate pair and represents a single code point (character).  (It just doesn't do much with this knowledge.)<p>You can assign '\ud83d\ude04' to document.body.innerHTML in modern Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.  In Safari you get a nice Emoji; in stock Chrome and Firefox, you don't, but the empty space is selectable and even copy-and-pastable as a smiley!  So the character is actually there, it just doesn't render as a smiley.<p>The bug that may have been present in V8 or Node is: what happens if you take this length-2 string and write it to a UTF8 buffer, does it get translated correctly?  Today, it does.<p>What if you put the smiley directly into a string literal in JS source code, not \u-escaped?  Does that work?  Yes, in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.",4833631,{4839081},,,,

When I observe an institution isn't sufficiently good, I pivot and fulfill my requirements elsewhere, for example by reading a book or meeting passionate people informally. I do not believe that this autodidacticism is great efficiency-wise, but often it's unfortunately better than alternatives.<p>When evaluating the earlier poster's anecdote of teaching 180 adults, of course it's very unlikely that she/he had the terrible luck to draw 180 (or even 100) genetic freaks who were born with terrible attitudes. (And even if she/he did, just wait a semester and problem solved!) Far more likely to me: at least one major institution failed them along the way. So it is clearly useful to identify which ones failed — especially if it's the one you're in, as that's the one you have most control over. (Teachers in particular have a position of power in the classroom.)<p>(The power of institutional analysis is you can completely replace the people in them, and they'll still function essentially the same.)<p>More important — if you realize that your approach is clearly unsuccessful, I think you need to stop, reevaluate and probably pivot. Be open to shattering your worldview. Rather than plod on stubbornly in a direction you know leads to abject failure, because most people around you are willing to fail miserably in the same way. (Or because ""But it's not in my job description!"") I do not intend to be such an extreme romanticist of failure. In fact, today I happened to institute post-mortems at work, to identify our little failures. Not to blame, but to improve.<p>It is important for teachers to have good attitudes, and it's disheartening to meet those ironically unwilling to learn.

Its strategic posture is primarily defensive, so accordingly its nuclear strategy is also defensive. This is why Israel's neighbours are not massively concerned about its nuclear stockpile.<p>Iran's government and military on the other hand have openly stated the country's regional hegemonic strategic ambitions. It wishes to weaken the Sunni Arab balance of power (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, etc) that has held sway over the region for the past few decades. Hence it should be regarded as a state which wishes to project power over its neighbours and become the primary influence in the region.<p>That difference in strategic outlook makes all the difference in the world, because it means that Iran is likely to use its nuclear capability as a protective umbrella under which it can undermine the Middle East's most powerful countries without fear of retaliation.<p>This is why the Wikileaks memos showed that most strong Arab powers were secretly in support of American or Israeli action against Iran. An unbalanced Middle East and an Iran free to use its proxies such as Hezbollah against whoever it chooses represent grave strategic threats to every established power in the Middle East. Any additional chaos in turn is dangerous for Israel, as are an unleashed Hezbollah and Hamas.<p>That's why it makes perfect sense for Israel to oppose Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons despite having an arsenal of its own and why other countries, including most of the EU, are more concerned about Iran building nuclear weapons than they are about Israel already having them.",4135409,{4136261},,,,

It is perfectly plausible that we have an elevated rate of gun ownership for historical or cultural reasons, and (since they are such highly engineered weapons) we tend to use guns to murder people, rather than other weapons.<p>If number of murders perpetrated with other weapons is lower than in other countries, its entirely possible that enforcing stricter gun control would not have a significant effect on the total number of murders.<p>Factors that might go against this hypothesis are the fact that gun availability might encourage people to kill more readily, gun availability makes a successful murder easier, etc...

As an afterthought, burgeoning fabrication methods (i.e. 3-D printing) will radically change arguments about gun control.

You don't need to be in the valley to be funded, you just need a compelling product/story/team/etc.<p>Plus, there are also many other startups that have gone beyond the incubator stage, but are not right or ready for VC. You would traditionally turn to Angels in that stage, but why not turn to your users, or the general public?",4381704,,,,,

5835956,,comment,nilkn,2013-06-07 00:26:09,"Oh boy, I have a lot of comments here, most of them in agreement with the article but not all.<p>According to all the anecdotal knowledge I have, my conclusion has been that currently software engineering and chemical engineering are tied for the locally optimal career choice for those with a four year degree or less. While some college graduates (or dropouts) will go become billionaires, as a general rule, it is quite hard to do better in a career without further education than you can with these two types of engineering.<p>Software and chemical engineering also both have their own ""meccas"": SV for software, Houston for chemical. Google/Facebook/etc. for software, Exxon/Chevron/etc. for chemical.<p>That said, anyone who thinks software developers are on the verge of being overpaid should consider how low developers (and most workers) are on the overall wage ladder. Maybe $150k sounds high to the typical person born and raised in the middle class, but that's pennies compared to the typical salaries in the true upper class. Moreover, the majority of developers making salaries around that number live in the most expensive cities in the country, not the cheaper ones.<p>As a general rule, software developers are in the middle class or upper middle class, but not the upper class. Of course, it depends on your definition of the various social classes. If you define it as the one percent, you'd need to make about $350k. If you define it as those whose primary income derives from investments rather than salaries, then even that is not nearly enough.<p>What's an example of something close to an ""upper class career""? Some but certainly not all doctors would make it. Family physicians wouldn't be close (they're about the same as engineers in the end), but specialized academic surgeons will make $500k-$1M/year. At many universities with medical schools, the top surgical faculty will make about double the president of the university.<p>A successful trader of financial assets can make seven figures. This is almost common on Wall Street, but it happens elsewhere. The youngest billionaire in Houston right now made his fortune from Enron: he was a trader of energy derivatives and after making the company some $75 million one year he was awarded about an $8M bonus. He then started his own energy trading firm and went on to make a few billion.<p>A partner at McKinsey, the management consulting firm, will make seven figures in total compensation. A partner at any major law firm will make the same.<p>These aren't extraordinarily difficult careers to get into. Becoming a surgeon is mostly about planning ahead and dedication. Becoming a partner at a firm is just about putting in the hours for years. Literally anybody on Wall Street will make $100k minimum unless they're like a receptionist, and from there you can work your way onto the trading floor.<p>And let's not even talk about top business executives, who put all those salaries to shame. And contrary to popular belief there is a reasonably effective method towards becoming such an executive: Harvard/Wharton MBA, consultant at McKinsey, eventually hired by a company you consulted for. That's how Skilling got on as CEO of Enron. That's how my friend's dad, a CEO making $4M/year, got his job. Etc. There are tons of examples of it.<p>It happens all the time. Most people just don't know about it. Many people often think it's all luck getting into the upper ranks of the executives, but that's because they think it's done by choosing a company at a young age and working there for 20+ years. That's not how it's done in general. It happens occasionally, but you have to network your ass off for decades to make that work. But if you're a consultant, then you'll be hired by the top executives to help them solve problems. You just skipped all the lower ranks thanks to just a few years of business school. (This doesn't work with an MBA from anywhere but the most prestigious schools.)<p>In short, there are a number of careers where at your peak you'll make not a six figure salary but a <i>seven</i> figure salary. If you think back to how long the phrase ""six figure salary"" has been in use, you'll realize that, with inflation, a seven figure salary is quite accurately the new six figure salary in expensive cities like SF and NYC. People in these cities who aren't making such a salary are often willfully ignorant of this fact. They want the prestige of a ""six figure salary,"" even though their buying power is an order of magnitude less than what that phrase originally referred to.",5831491,"{5836481,5835983,5836176,5841318}",,,,

If you're a recent graduate who's very green and looking for experience, you'll <i>still</i> find any number of paid opportunities.<p>At the previous company I worked for, I had managed quite a few <i>paid</i> interns. I love managing, but I've always turned down serious management positions out of fear that I'd fall behind from a technical standpoint. I have never turned down an opportunity to manage an intern and my company took the relationship seriously. Interns negotiated salary just like any other employee, however, they were treated as a short-term contract so as a manager I was not able to see salary specifics. Despite that, I've been confided in and they were doing quite. Minimum wage was nowhere to be found.<p>Purely for CS grads looking to land a career in software development (and I'm not in The Valley where things are arguably quite different): Don't take an unpaid internship. If the place is incredible and you <i>really, really</i> want to work there, ask yourself why they're not willing to pay you. My former company hired some of the greenest interns* from colleges you've likely never heard of. They were paid and they were all very good after a couple of months of apprenticeship.

[e]veryone wants one, but no one wants to pay for it"" is absurd.  We see many examples of charitable contributions made by the rich and the middle class which are used to purchase public goods such as museums, nature preserves and the like.<p>When push comes to shove, what Buffet really wants -- and what you are advocating when you say that no matter how much money he donates, it ""will not be enough to solve our budget issues"" -- is an increase in the size of government fueled by higher taxes, rather than a diminution of its scope by reducing the funds made available to it.<p>A bigger government benefits crony capitalists like Buffet, because they have sufficient power and influence to ensure that the goodies that can be redistributed by the Leviathan are steered their way.

I get a rush every time I rip a package open.  Two, it's good for the ego.  It helps you keep perspective on how much you've been reading.  Three, you can underline the books as you read them, this can be VERY helpful. Unfortunately I do not recommend loaning books to friends, you will never get them back.<p>Awesome! You can start by reading 1 book a week, which is an aggressive but doable goal.

The key word here is <i>actionable</i>.  How often do you come across something that actually changes your plans or the way you're doing things?  It's really very rare, in any field.  It certainly doesn't require a daily investment, and probably not even a weekly investment.<p>A few time I've either been traveling or in crunch mode for a few weeks and been unable to waste time perusing the journals and feeds I usually do.  When I finally had a chance to catch up, I found that I could rapidly skim the pile of stuff I would have wasted many hours reading and pick out all the salient information in under an hour.<p>It's also important to remember we live in the google age and finding information is easy.  There's a tendency to suck down information thinking it might be handy later, but a JIT approach to reading and research is probably a lot more efficient.  When what to do isn't obvious you can find what's been written fast.  Remember that you probably have access through your library to lexis-nexis and other databases that allow you to search pretty much everything that gets published.<p>People like to procrastinate by reading blogs and ""news items"" and pretend they're actually doing useful research.

I am graduating in less than 2 months with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science (BSACS) and feel clueless about what is approaching rapidly - a.k.a THE REAL WORLD.  I know this question has been asked and answered countless times (most of which I feel that I have read), but as is the case with all in the tech world, often this information becomes dated rapidly, is one sided or extremely biased.  So again, what concepts, technologies, languages and various disciplines do I need to KNOW in order to be proficient, or at least to be good enough to land a job, as a professional programmer?<p>I find myself feeling as if I know all this 'programming stuff' but have no real clue of how to sit down and work in a development environment with other developers on a real project.  Not only this, but I feel that I know a little about a lot - i.e. I am a jack of all trades, but a master of none. Clearly I have done problem solving and system design in my classes, but these projects are limited to core concepts based heavily on CS theory and are often very limited in size and complexity.  I have been exposed to C++ (4 classes), Java (2 classes), VB.Net (1 Class), SQL (1 class), Discrete Mathematics (1 class), Project design and management (1 class), Advanced Algorithms and Design (1 class) as well as a sprinkling of various other 'CS-related' classes via my education.  On the side I have played and dabbled with Ruby, Python, PHP, C, C# and a handful of other technologies that escape me now.  I have a 3.6 GPA and have not made less than an A in my core CS classes since the beginning, but again, I still feel clueless.<p>Any tips, suggestions or criticisms are warmly welcomed (well, except criticism, which will be welcomed, just without the warm feelings attached).  Please, where time and willingness permits, be specific - do I need to know how to design/write a compiler?  do I need to know assembly (taking that class this term anyways)?  If I want to make money first and worry about fun later, should I focus on corporate adopted technologies (Java, anything Microsoft, etc.)?<p>Thanks in advance!<p>-Matt",,"{136090,136111,136256,136377,136223,136222,136315,136961,136374,136116,136387,136375,136158,136240,136140,136146,136195,136560,136713}",,19,"Ask YC: What do I, a graduating CS student, need to know to go into the real world as a programmer?",50

Nothing is more infuriating that attempting to discuss ethics with people who are congenitally dishonest in their choice of language. It's like trying to discuss good-grooming with a person who's got a stained shirt, dirt under their fingernails, and an open fly. Instant credibility killer.<p>I think the real problem is that folks arguing form this position really don't want to admit that tangible goods and intangible goods are very different things, that they both demand their own governing codes, and (critically) these codes have very little overlap, either conceptually or practically.<p>Ultimately, this whole ""duplication is theft"" comes across as a giant land-grab. Thanks to technological developments, we've seen explosive growth in the realm of intangible goods. The folks in the IP business (who did next to nothing in creating this new state) would like us to ignore the fact that the laws governing IP were written before the internet existed. And they'd like us to pretend that those laws would be exactly the same had they been written after the emergence of the internet. Accordingly, we should just transpose our legal code from one sphere to another, and expect everything to work perfectly.<p>Never mind that the application of this law in the new sphere leads to instant conflicts with the underlying authority on which the initial law was based. Ignore, too, the fact that enforcement, to be effective, must involve surveillance with an absolutely nauseating ubiquity (itself a clearly illegal proposition). And pretend - for a moment - that this is really incidental regulation, not something that has a determining role in the fundamental architecture of the internet.<p>In short, pretend that's it's possible to discover fire, but legislate away some of the heat.<p>But there's more to it than not wanting to see a new code that's not as favorable to distributers as the old code. What folks making the ""copyright is theft"" argument would also like us to ignore is the degree to which our political system has been captured and undermined by private lobbies - a very nasty development that is presently generating a larger crisis of legitimacy that threatens everything Congress touches - including the old code.<p>Having already spent millions to (legally) bribe congresspeople, the folks saying ""theft!"" know they are deeply, deeply wrong. They know they represent a corrupting influence in America life. They know that they depend on a set of rules that have become odious. And they want - desperately - to avoid any clear conversation about this. Ergo, you see the constant effort to confuse the meaning of words, to ignore the actual scope and wording of the law, and - above all - to avoid any reckoning with the fundamental premise that allows the issuance of copyrights in the first place.<p>Well, they're not the only ones who can set the rules of engagement. And I think the first rule that honest people should insist on is the accurate and precise use of language.<p>I realize that this small bit of honesty is, itself, a threat to those who would use ""theft"" to describe unauthorized duplication. The fact that they're willing to fiercely defend their tendency to abuse semantics should signal just how thin the ice under them really is. I mean, if you can't have a conversation without warping  the meaning of the words you use, is it because you don't actually have anything to say? Or are you worried that the whole edifice you've built is so fragile that the slightest crack will cause the entire thing to implode?<p>Here's a bit of advice: stop worrying. It's already too late. The old order has already failed. What we're living in now is an Interregnum - the period of limbo that exists between the end of one system, and the point where a new system is strong enough to sweep away the remaining dregs. I'll be the first to agree that this is a very difficult time for artists caught in the crossfire. I mean, the old system can no longer protect them, while the new system cannot yet provide for them. It's awful. But that's reality.  All anyone can hope to do is hold on long enough to ride out the disruption stemming from what is, by any measure, a tremendous historical development.<p>So onward through the fog.",3135620,,,,,

  &#62; they're international, aren't charged on a per-call or 
  &#62; per-minute basis (in the US, YMMV elsewhere).
</code></pre>
It's somewhat off-topic to your main point, but I'm from the US, and I don't think this is true.  While there are flat-rate calling plans, these are new and more commonly associated with VOIP lines.  I think that most people in the US still have plans with very complex rates based on destination and time-of-day.  For example:<p>---<p>What are AT&#38;T basic rates? What is the AT&#38;T basic rate plan?<p>They are the standard long distance rates charged to customers who are not enrolled in an AT&#38;T Long Distance calling plan. There is a $4.95 monthly recurring charge associated with the state to state direct dialed basic rate plan (sometimes referred to as the basic rate plan), which applies each month whether or not a customer makes a call. The current per minute state-to-state basic rates are as follows: 42¢ Peak (7 AM - 6:59 PM, M - F), 36.5¢ Off Peak (12 AM - 6:59 AM and 7 PM - 11:59 PM, M - F) and 15¢ on Weekends. In-state basic rates vary by state.<p><a href=""https://www.customerservice.att.com/assistance/faq/qa.jsp?faqCategoryId=ld_shop_faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.customerservice.att.com/assistance/faq/qa.jsp?fa...</a><p>---<p>Incredibly, due to federal telecommunications regulations, the in-state rates have historically been higher than the state-to-state rates. What you say is true about local calls though, where ""local"" is a complex term of the art rather than something simple.  And times are changing --- for all I know, no one buy my family members are still on the traditional plans.<p>With regard to apps, I think I see it opposite to the way you do.  Previously, most small apps would be directly accessed as free websites with no metering.  Now, more of these micro-services are moving to becoming paid apps, free-loading on top of the public web sites. Would you be comfortable with the NYC metro deciding not to put up a public information site at all, and offering only a paid app?

Note that this is talking specifically about elevated arrest rates of drug _offenders_, so the fact that the amount of drug usage between the two groups may differ is not relevant.

Friends and family will ask what the stone is, and need to be educated. And no matter what you tell them, the perception will be that I was too cheap to buy her a real engagement ring. Nevermind the fact that I'm not actually saving any money, I'm just spending it <i>somewhat</i> more wisely.<p>It's actually a little bit of a stressful situation for me. I'm in the Royal Canadian Mint's MintChip Challenge, and I'm hoping to win some gold from the competition, so I can melt it down and make an engagement ring for her from that. In my eyes, that has more meaning behind it. Moreover, she's going on a trip with her sister to Prague &#38; Rome in a month, a few days before our 7 year anniversary. Since she knows a proposal is coming, I was hoping to surprise her by showing up in Rome and proposing to her there. May not be the wisest way to spend my money, especially when I'm not exactly swimming in cash right now, but I felt it would be worth it for the memory and moment.

4536236,,comment,stryker,2012-09-18 04:53:37,"I feel like a lot of people here misunderstand the speed of light as a cosmic speed limit. The speed of light as a speed limit is a <i>local</i> constraint. On a larger scale there is no such speed limit. Just because you travel faster than light on a non-local scale does not mean you break causality.<p>For example, light ""travels"" more slowly through water than vacuum. Well, actually, photons travel at <i>c</i> always -- it's just that light gets bounced around by water molecules, getting absorbed and reabsorbed many many times before arriving at the destination. It's like driving to a destination as opposed to running to it. If the roads are curvy enough, the runner will win because he is not constrained by roads. Could it be that the Alcubierre drive gets past the roads of empty space in a way light cannot?<p>For a better example, consider the expansion of the universe. Link: <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575</a>. I quote:<p><i>The fact that galaxies we see now are moving away from us faster than the speed of light has some bleak consequences, however. Astronomers now have strong evidence that we live in an ""accelerating universe,"" which means that the speed of each individual galaxy with respect to us will increase as time goes on. If we assume that this acceleration continues indefinitely, then galaxies which are currently moving away from us faster than the speed of light will always be moving away from us faster than the speed of light and will eventually reach a point where the space between us and them is stretching so rapidly that any light they emit after that point will never be able to reach us.</i><p>In other words, vacuum fills in between us and far away galaxies faster than light can traverse it. Again, locally, the derivative of position with respect to time is <i>c</i>, but the universe is able to ""cheat"" by messing around with the definition of position. If the Alcubierre drive messes with the fabric of the universe in a similar way, I don't see any reason why it cannot succeed.<p>Here's a related link: <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=56"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=56</a>. I quote:<p><i>Technically speaking, the speed of light limit only applies when you are in an ""inertial frame"" -- that is, sitting where you are, without any forces acting on you, and measuring the speed of an object that moves past a ruler and clock that you are holding in your hand. Across the large distances in the universe, however, we have a very different set of circumstances. No one is in an inertial frame, because everyone is being accelerated with respect to everyone else, due to the universe's gravitational field and the fact that the universe is expanding. In effect, the universe's expansion isn't really due to galaxies moving ""through space"" away from each other, but rather due to the stretching of space itself, which isn't governed by the same limits that we are.</i><p>I'm not sure whether the Alcubierre drive contradicts causality, but if it does, I highly doubt that it is because of the arguments presented on this forum.",4535149,{4536320},,,,

We can be proud and say that such ads have no effect on our behavior, but statistics say otherwise.<p>This does not actually have to be true. Think about Windows Home vs Professional; it actually takes Microsoft much more work to offer both rather than offer just Professional. The experience is strictly worse for the user, and Microsoft makes less per sale on Home.<p>So why do they even have a Home edition? It's because of market segmentation and pricing strategies. If it costs $70 marginal cost to manufacture a kindle, you will make some amount of money from each person that pays $79.<p>What if $9 * # of potential purchases at that price point is less than the flat R&#38;D costs? Then you can't make money at that price point. Now imagine all the kindles cost $100; a lot less people might buy it at $100 than would at $79. It's actually often in the best interest of the company if they could get half the people to pay $100, and anyone who would refuse to pay that to still buy it at $79.<p>The only way to make that happen is to have to make some sort of differentiating factor that is minor enough so price sensitive people will still buy it, but that people who have the extra money will still pay the higher price. Windows professional is the same as basic for the vast majority of people, yet people still buy professional because to the people who are less price sensitive, it's worth it to not even <i>hypothetically</i> be missing features.<p>In that way, they could easily be making $0 from the ads, or even negative income by showing the ads and still have it be a good idea to make a version with ads that costs less than the version without ads.

Market neutral is a farce because of the one thing all arbs use - leverage - lots and lots of leverage. If you use leverage - you must assume that anything that can blow up in your face will - usually at the worst possible moment. That includes all shorters, derivative sellers and leveraged net-long funds.<p>They win a little every day - keeping their volatility in check - as if that fucking measures risks, and they do that year, after year, after year. 5 years later - BA BOOM! They blow themselves out of the water because during crises all correlations go to one and counterparty and liquidity risk get you killed as your convergence pairs blow themselves to smithereens.<p>Hell even the shorters can get perilously close to not getting paid. John Paulson made a ton of money, but only after his counterparties came through. They almost didn't pay up because the world was crashing around them and they had no cash on hand. Michael Burry also got himself into a similar situation. If you are betting for the end of the world, you should probably consider that no one will have enough cash to actually pay you and would rather default and see you squirm. Even when you bet for the end of the world - you're net long.<p>This is fundamentally what shorters don't seem to get - you can't bet for the end of the world - because if you do a) no one will pay you, or b) if they do, you won't be able to throw out your gigantic mounds of paper fast enough to get your hands on guns, food, water and shelter.<p>There is no such thing as risk-less arbitrage in the real world - just like there's no such thing as efficient markets, an economist who knows what he's doing, a finance major who knows how to invest or a hedge fund manager who is actually market neutral.

In these regions the compass points in the opposite direction, in or out of the core, compared to that of surrounding areas. It is the growth in area of such a reversed flux patch under the south Atlantic that is primarily responsible for the decay in the main dipolar field. This reverse patch is also responsible for the minimum in field strength called the South Atlantic Anomaly, centred over North-east Brazil. In this region energetic particles can approach Earth more closely, causing increased radiation risk to low Earth orbit satellites.</i><p><a href=""http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/reversals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/reversals.html</a>",4035773,,,,,

They are far more likely to complain and require support.<p>God forbid you are selling at a one-time-fee (which is why I think the current mobile development land-grab will flame out and transform into services-on-your-phone).  You are going to be expected to provide support forever, at the drop of a hat, for any version of your application.  Figure out a way to get recurring.<p>If you go cheap/free, you monetize with ads (often ineffective and always annoying to your users) or by spying on your users.  I doubt many of us want to do the latter (Although, sadly, enough of us might to knock out the ones who don't.  Race to the bottom!)<p>I now want to pay good money for the apps I use: I want the developer(s) to eat and drive nice cars.

In reality, decision-making and action can be so diffused in a large organization that no individual could possibly be held morally responsible for the resulting collective action. If you've ever been caught in a human stampede, you will understand the feeling of being part of something terribly destructive, and yet helpless to stop it. A corporation (and any other large social organization) is a complex adaptive system, truly a separate entity in its own right. But not an entity with anything resembling human intelligence, and certainly not an entity that can be deterred by legal sanctions any more than a mob can be deterred, short of sanctions that actually dissolve the entity.

Saving your memory for ""important things"" will only deprive you of essentially free practice. The periodic table is actually a good place to start as long as you don't overwhelm yourself, so for example start with the names of the elements in order, then the numbers will associate, and you can keep building with recursion.

I'll elaborate on this:<p>When the US colonies first started, they had a tiny population trying to hold their own, spread out in a vast wilderness.  A gun can be used to defend against criminals, hostile natives, or can be used for hunting.  Remember, homes were often miles apart, there were no telephones to dial 911, and the nearest police force might be in one of relatively few cities or forts, tens or hundreds of miles away.  <i>Not</i> letting people own weapons would have made the colonists' lives much harder.<p>Once enough guns are out there, it gets harder and harder to argue that they should be outlawed, because:<p>(1) A culture of gun ownership develops, which will be upset if you try to take them away<p>(2) A sizable number of guns will presumably escape the confiscation program and enter the hands of criminals<p>Add to this, the country's experiences during the war of independence convinced its founders of the benefits of empowering the citizens to rise up against foreign invaders or an oppressive government.<p>As for why there's not more support for ""common-sense regulation,"" no less a hacker than Eric S. Raymond has recently given a cogent explanation [1] [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4912"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4912</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4939"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4939</a>",5716484,,,,,

The producer explains what he&#x2F;she wants, the engineers just implement it.<p>For example, artist comes in with guitar, a chord progression, and a song. Producers says &#x27;let&#x27;s plug your guitar in a Marshall Amp and mike the cab, then we&#x27;ll double-track that with the direct signal.&#x27; Engineers goes and sets everything up, and at most makes suggestions on what sort of microphone to use or that this configuration sounds especially good with a bit of room sound, and takes care of setting up the mixing desk to avoid distortion on the recording and phasing between the direct and amplified signals.<p>Most producers start out as engineers rather than musicians.

There's something to be said about consoles and how they provide developers with <i>one</i> standardized specification that they can target over a span of 6+ years that enables them to optimize games so they run smoothly while squeezing out every last drop of power the console has to offer. Gaming PCs lack this standardization that consoles enjoy. Sure, there's infinite flexibility with what you're able to do with a PC -- such as using it as a HTPC -- but over time, a Steam Box built today won't be able to play the latest games that 2017 has to offer with any grace, while the PS3 will be running a title like ""The Last of Us"" nearly seven years after the console's introduction. Sure, you could always upgrade the graphics card, CPU, HD, and other components, but now you've already overpaid what you would have had you bought a PS4/Xbox 720.<p>Just something to keep in mind for anyone who decides to build a Steam Box in hopes that is can replace a console.",4885372,"{4886099,4886088}",,,,

Hence the difference in perception between various people.<p>- The whole-screen app stuff is a good idea, but the implementation sucks on multiple monitors, which many geeks use (the problem is: when you go full screen on one monitor, the other no longer shows anything by gray linen)<p>- Many features were removed for what seems to be no good reason, e.g. RSS feeds.<p>- Some iPad-like behaviors make little sense on a desktop, e.g. automatically closing Safari if idle for a while. It takes several seconds to open a web link just because it has to relaunch the application.<p>- Annoying for my company, Taodyne (3D presentations): stereoscopy used to be perfectly stable on 10.6, unstable since 10.7, to the point of causing kernel panics or system freezes regularly.<p>- Memory management has been a weak point since Rhapsody. In Rhapsody, you could crash the system simply by zooming in Preview. Today, you can still halt your top-of-the-line system to a crawl simply by running a process that eats all available memory. I'd much rather have an easy quota system where I can say ""unless otherwise specified, no app can take more than 1/4th of available RAM"". Or a paging system that makes smarter decisions and keeps the ""interactive"" stuff resident enough that I can still kill the offending process.<p>- Tons of annoying little bugs at the lowest levels, and you really wonder what was broken there that they needed to fix. Like the mouse cursor that sometimes disappears. Or the keyboard that sometimes forgets half the keys you type. Or Safari that stops refreshing part of the screen. Or moving a window across monitors that now causes the window and background icons to blink. And so on. Lion does not feel as polished as Snow Leopard.<p>Overall, I still like Apple products, but I definitely see them losing their edge on the software quality front.

If there's one thing Microsoft should know by now, its that the tech-savvy folks will take every chance to ridicule any slight flaw in their products. They should have learned this after their driver disaster in Windows ME. The same driver/hardware compatibility issue shouldn't have happened in Vista, but it did. The same lack of benefit awareness shouldn't be happening with Windows 8, but it is.<p>Microsoft needs to realize that they're selling in a crowded space now. They're not the only players, so they can't rely on a lack of choice forcing people to understand their products. Before anyone is ever told that there's a new Microsoft product, Microsoft needs to get their marketing people to explain what the product is, how users will benefit from it, and why it's better than the competition (or their previous products.) And this needs to extend to their hardware/software partners. I had problems with Vista originally because Creative kept telling me that the XP drivers for my soundcard would work. They didn't.<p>Microsoft seemingly releases a product and hopes the market will get it. In the past, it was adapt or die because MS was the only real game in town. Today they need marketing first, <i>then</i> engineering. If enthusiasts decide they don't like the product, that's what they're going to tell non-enthusiasts.

Most of recent open source software that managed to build up market- and mind-share quickly was put out under MIT license.<p>GPL-like licenses are becoming an off-putting factor nowadays simply because you expect to be offered a 'double-licensing' option somewhere down the line.

For an IBM the GPL is just fine, they have the size to compete against anyone with value added services on top of Linux. For smaller, open source projects I've seen them prefer apache 2.0, I speculate because it encourages commercial growth. When you're IBM someone has to grow pretty big to pose a threat. For their other closed products they continue to enjoy great revenues. They can put the resources into keeping them best of breed.<p>At the end of the day I believe the GPL best serves the rights of individual programmers and a moral argument can be made that software, just like mathematics, should be free.

1) Problem solving - the ability to break problems down into simple task that then can be trivially solved.
2) Data structures - programs are unless unless they have data to work with.  Knowing how to best represent it is vital, do you use an array, linked list, tree etc.
3) Algorithms - known ways of operating on data to produce some out come.  Everything from using a loop to add numbers, to sorting lists, or adding a node to a red-black tree.
4) Design Patterns - know ways to structure code, in a tried and tested fashion.
5) Architecture and Interface design - how to structure your project as a whole (what goes where) and how to set how one portion interacts with all the others.<p>Along with many other things.

Come on, people. If we can't do better than that on Hacker fricking News, perhaps the doomsayers are right after all and this neighborhood is done.<p>Hold on, newsisan, there are thousands of Python hackers here. Let's see if any cavalry ride to your rescue.<p>I'm not a Python guy so this will be weak, but I'll do my bit.<p>1. Community. Python is far more widespread in the web, open source, and scientific communities. It will be much easier to find interesting projects to play with and libraries to build on.<p>2. Simplicity. Contrary to what your teacher may have heard, Python is an excellent beginner language. VB.Net is actually way more complicated. It's Microsoft propaganda that positions VB.Net as the best language for beginners. (Edit: it seems nearly everyone here disagrees with this. Am I crazy? Let's hear from some Python people.)<p>3. Quality. Python is far more organized around clean programming constructs and practices than VB.Net, which is an arbitrary mess.<p>4. Openness. Python gives all the advantages of an open codebase and platform. I suppose I should list some, but I'm tired.<p>5. The REPL (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop</a>) is hands-down the best technique for playing with programming concepts, trying out ideas and getting feedback, learning, and coming up with the building blocks for programs. Once you've gotten comfortable with the REPL you'll never want to live without it again. No one should learn programming without this invaluable resource, which Python has and VB.Net does not.<p>5. Cool. VB.Net is the ultimate in uncool. Python holds its own just fine. Frivolous? Yeah, but there are deep reasons for these things. Learn Python so the other programmers won't smell VB on you and peck you to death.<p>Good luck!<p>p.s. A simple additional principle you should know: never try to talk a programmer out of their favorite language. It can't be done. If your teacher is deeply attached to VB.Net, just go with what he wants and enjoy the positive aspects of the class (if he's a great teacher, that's the most important thing anyway and you're lucky to have him). If he doesn't care that much, though, maybe you can wear him down with your enthusiasm. :)<p>pp.s. Worst case scenario, write all the programs in Python and then rewrite them in VB.Net to hand in.

Security if the uptime was achieved by not applying kernel updates, or reliability if some kind of hack to update a running kernel without a reboot was used.<p>The latter is a reliability problem because rebooting after a major update serves a purpose other than just loading the new kernel. It also serves the purpose of showing that the update has not broken configurations or dependencies required to boot. It's a heck of a lot better to discover that an update has left your system non-bootable right after the update, rather than finding out months later when some hardware failure takes down the server and then you find it doesn't boot and you've got to go back through months of changes trying to figure it out.",4685474,"{4686878,4686978}",,,,

It was the only way to get good performance.  But the holy grail has always been shared memory, not message passing.  But perf for shared memory applications has continued to be horrible.  But anyone who has experience writing a message passing and a shared memory version almost always concedes the shared memory version is easier.<p>Large scale parallel message passing apps are extremely difficult to get right.  Most people just haven't done it.  With that said, some of the difficulties in the past where tied to the fact that message passing was done with a weak type system, no contracts (I sent you message, but how do I know you're ever going to respond to it?), and weak support for gather/scatter.<p>AFAICT, not having done much at all with Erlang, it deals nicely with the type system issue, but contracts are still a problem.  Gather/scatter is partially assisted in the same way that PM/FM handled it in the past (you get to write code to pull messages out of your mailbox).<p>My prediction is that if message passing does take off in a big way, we'll see a pretty strong backlash to shared memory with functionality, such as type ownership and data representation synthesis.

If in addition we know that angle C is a right angle, then we have the Pythagorean theorem.<p>Well, to conclude the Pythagorean theorem, it is just crucial to have a suitable assumption, say, angle C is a right angle.  Else the Pythagorean theorem does not hold.<p>We know these things.<p>'Machine learning' is a four letter word -- junk.  Here is why:  They have a 'paradigm':  Get an 'algorithm' from somewhere, put it a black box, and say ""Try this!"".  By analogy, this is mixing up snake oil instead of good chemistry.<p>The big, huge problem is that, with their nonsense paradigm, there is no good reason to believe that the black box has any value.  By analogy, they take the Pythagorean theorem and apply it to all triangles ignoring if there is a right angle or not.<p>There is a rational sickness ubiquitous in 'computer science':  Take results from mathematics and with great determination ignore the assumptions.  Machine learning is one of the sickest.<p>Bluntly put, done with any rational care, machine learning is a topic in applied math, but the workers in the field know far too little math, make gross mistakes at nearly every chance, and, in particular, ignore the mathematical assumptions and, thus, proceed with no rational support.<p>Computing was not always this way:  The origins of electronic digital computing were in scientific calculations in WWII.  D. Knuth's books on 'The Art of Computer Programming' are fairly careful mathematically.<p>At the time of the first editions of Knuth's books, hot topics were 'algorithms', especially for sorting and searching.  So, there it was fairly clear what such an algorithm was to do.<p>Then the definition of an 'algorithm' grew to include just any piece of code that ran and, hopefully, usually stopped, and what properties the results had were not emphasized.  So, we have gone some years with a programmer announcing that they have an algorithm to tell people, say, what they should eat for breakfast.  They call a venture partner who says, ""So, you have an algorithm."".  Gee, anyone can have an algorithm for anything; the question is, what properties does the algorithm have?  As long as computing wants to ignore the properties and the assumptions, they will have a tough time doing better than snake oil.<p>Part of this very relaxed attitude toward algorithms came from early work in 'artificial intelligence' (AI) where the criteria were:<p>""Do you have running code?  Does the code produce something that at first glance looks like something a human might do?"".<p>Then these criteria opened the doors wide to just any intuitive, heuristic, or black box techniques.  In particular, now can call nearly anything 'machine learning'.<p>Actually just guessing, as from intuitive and heuristic efforts, is a tough way to find something powerful for a challenging problem.  Instead, starting with some assumptions and doing some derivations is much more powerful, e.g., as for the law of cosines and the Pythagorean theorem.<p>The problem for AI, machine learning, etc. in computer science proceeding mathematically is that the corresponding math is often a bit advanced, and the profs didn't take the right courses in grad school and don't know the math.<p>Actually, for 'learning', there is a lot that is quite solid in parts of mathematical statistics.  There the math is done with good care, is basically correct; and someone with a better math background than many of the statistics profs can make the math rock solid.  There is more for 'learning' in optimization, control theory, and stochastic optimal control.<p>So, much of AI and machine learning is a C- student's rip off of some Cliffs Notes summary of mathematical statistics applied ignoring the assumptions.  Bummer.<p>All that said, if you want to see AI approach <i>the singularity</i> where there is something like actual intelligence, then it does appear that you will need some very new approaches and ideas.  Even done very well, not all of this work will be solid mathematics.<p>In the meanwhile, broadly the <i>good stuff</i> is in selected topics in mathematics.  I suggest you emphasize linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and optimization and then relatively advanced approaches to probability, stochastic processes, and mathematical statistics.",2180911,,,,,

Some of these reasons are selfish, and some are completely altruistic. Many are both selfish and altruistic- one could easily argue that the FSF falls into that category, not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.<p>The whole point of creating Open Source was to acknowledge that. The GNU philosophy is very, very, very specific in its means and goals and presents a very specific worldview, and plenty of people (maybe even the majority?) who are interested sharing code don&#x27;t agree with much of it.<p>You state that Open Source was created &quot;to keep the code sharing parts while shedding the ethical positions of the GNU philosophy&quot;, and many of the people who were instrumental in creating the concept would agree with you. But the reason the concept has stuck around has nothing to do with that. It&#x27;s just a very, very useful concept. It&#x27;s very handy to have some way to refer to software for which source code is available, redistributable, and reuseable, and not instantly imply all of the metric ton of legal or philosophical baggage associated with FSF-approved projects.<p>Someone who doesn&#x27;t agree with the ethical portions of the GNU philosophy isn&#x27;t unethical, they just have a different point of view. Yet, that&#x27;s what you imply in your phrasing. Tons of people who contribute greatly to Open Source (or even Free Software!) consider certain elements of the GNU philosophy to be unethical. This whole &quot;with us or against us&quot; attitude is what turns off so many people to the FSF and RMS in the first place. It&#x27;s like PETA saying that you are either 100% on board with them and everything they do, or you are in favor of murdering puppies, and there&#x27;s no middle ground or room for more nuanced perspectives or alternative philosophies.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against the GNU philosophy; I agree with much of it and strongly disagree with some other parts of it.

I know Python and C++ at about the same level and for a lot of things I find myself taking less time in C++, particularly with Boost giving me a bunch of handy tools in my toolbox. I don&#x27;t find static typing onerous, and it does save my bacon more often than it gets in my way.<p>Nits about C++ aside, since there does exist the general perception of C++ as having those problems, wouldn&#x27;t a fairer comparison be Scala or C# as it pertains to statically typed languages? (I don&#x27;t know Scala great yet, but I find myself able to build good, reliable code fairly quickly--although sometimes, due to unfamiliarity, I end up writing code that&#x27;s too clever and it&#x27;s hard to read afterwards--and I am <i>ridiculously</i> more productive in C# than Python.

6286405,,comment,tcskeptic,2013-08-27 22:25:34,"Yes, this exactly, and observed in practice.  Layoffs in non-union shops are not done by seniority (Talking manufacturing here) they are done by relatively objective measures of employee &quot;goodness&quot; things like attendance, piece productivity, safety procedure compliance, etc.  We (in manufacturing) know this before the layoffs occur and account for it in financial and strategic planning.  We also account for it when hiring starts again.  Not only will skill levels go down, but far from the new folks arriving with universally great attitudes and work ethics after having been unemployed for a while, the incoming workers on average will be significantly less productive attitude wise than the existing workforce.  This will only gradually improve until the next downturn. The newly hired who are truly terrible will probably get fired in the interim, the newly hired who are mediocre will bump along and be the first out the door during the next layoff.  (And yes, the sad truth is that cyclical layoffs are a fact of life for many manufacturing workers)<p>I assume that this would apply in other industries as well.",6285859,,,,,

Zamalka was scene of one of the gas attacks that killed multitudes.<p>Before this attack I covered Zamalka, and an attack on it from al-Assad perched above the neighborhood. Forgive me for yet another re-post but this is very important as far as what the SEA is, what the end result of their campaigns are, the reality of the technological side of surveillance.<p>Repost:<p>I wondered why Zamalka was so familiar as I was writing my previous comment up, turns out I covered it before.<p>There has been persistent shelling from Assad loyalist neighborhoods down onto Zamalka below it. One video of such volleys of indiscriminate fire captured the essence of the situation, so I took frames of the video and stitched them into a panorama with a wider field of view than what the video provided[1].<p>The neighborhood with what most likely is howitzers is al-Assad,[2] and I say howitzers due to the neighborhood being military housing for the military artillery base north of it. This is very striking to what was documented to happen on the other side of Damascus to the west, where another set of military housing was scene wanton violence.<p>In Jdaidat Artouz civilians were taken by Assad&#x27;s military officers and lynched to death in a heap at the military family housing block either in or near the town (Jdaidat Artouz or Moadamiyet al-Shams). Video taken by some of the offenders shows the victims unloaded from a military truck being struck while shouted at by military and civilian persons. Later video shows the the pile of victims mostly motionless. Even later video shows them being further crushed with a tractor, throats slit.<p>Both cases have the military feeding off victim populations as if they were supermarket meat, there for picking and abuse. With offenders deployed from military housing.

There is no legal punishment for acting like an asshole, but in human society you more often than not pay a price for it. There is no such onus on corporations and in fact the ""business ethics"" we govern our corporations by can easily be put at odds with what you and I would consider ethical behavior (see Ford Pinto [1]).

You use the word in both senses interchangeably, and your use of the word thinking itself is also muddled.

I want all my working copies to be the same. I want new branches to propagate. I want branch deletions to propagate.<p>I've thought about scripting some of this, but for some pieces I am not sure how to proceed. Consider branch deletion. The problem here is that I can delete the branch from the main repository, but that doesn't force deletion for each of the clients. Instead, I would need to write a custom ""git pull"" style command that I run in a working directory before I start my work. Should this command delete all remote branches so that actual deletions are propagated, and then ""git pull"" restores the remote branches which still exist?<p>[edit: I've discovered that ""git remote prune"" will delete remote tracking branches that are no longer in the repo]<p>Don't other git users have this issue? Presumably there are others who work from more than one location and want a consistent view from each, yet I can't seem to google for any help on these issues.",285587,{285853},,,,

784491,,story,atiw,2009-08-25 09:57:03,"Hi everyone,
This is my first post here.
I have been just a silent reader all this time. 
Finally I get to post something as well.
Hope this helps others as well.<p>So, let's get started.
(P.S. - I am avoiding mentioning names of stuff like university etc, since it will be very<p>embarrassing if this gets read by my future co-founder, as he doesn't know about this dilemma i am facing yet)<p>First, A little background. I graduated as a Master's in CS from a reputable university this<p>summer. I am planning to start this company that uses AI to solve some major NP complete<p>problems related to resource allocation problems. It's planned to be a software product company.<p>This has been a product of my master's thesis.
So, obviously the IP(Intellectual Property) is in both mine and my adviser's name. This idea is<p>basically an evolution of his idea, which his earlier students had been trying their hands on,<p>but it didn't quite work as well as it was supposed to be.<p>And finally, I came along and with all my magic touch (If you can believe that), we did it. I<p>started implementing from scratch and finally after one and half years or so, we got it working.
Now, this product has myriad applications and all that, but we want to focus on two, at most,<p>for now, and see where we go from there. and when i say we, i mean the company.<p>I guess we have enough information now.<p>I have two major questions for you guys.<p>1. I have to incorporate this company sometime this week, since we had a demo last Friday and it<p>went very well. Now, the users are asking for this product, so this is the right time to incorporate and start selling i guess.<p>Now, I am not sure what kind of company it has to be.
According to Ycombinator FAQs, we need to be a C-Corp. I am wondering ""Is that like the common<p>requirement to accept money from any of the other investors as well? or is it just YC? "".
How about other types?  LLC? etc etc. I am not even sure what other types are out there, except these and S-corps.
How about S-Corps? I have heard about S-Corp but i am not really sure if startups qualify.<p>2. And the more important one. So, I finally had the guts to ask him (my adviser) about our<p>stock distribution as co founders of this new company.
His thoughts were the following:<p>""We make it 50-50, except since he will be continuing his full time job as a professor/head of department and I am doing all the coding full time (most of it is done already), I get a fixed salary(not yet decided) first from the revenue and then we evenly get 50-50.""<p>Now, I was all happy with this for a few hours, thinking this is great. I start selling my<p>product, and apply to Ycombinator, which obviously is going to invest once they hear of me, my co founder, my company and my product. And I get to go live in bay area and share the startup experience with you guys.<p>And then i called people to talk about this and share this great news...
I go : ""Hey, listen, my adviser wants to open a company with me. How cool is that? This is totally awesome. He is a genius, and 
now he wants to partner with me""<p>Too bad, I had mixed opinions from them and that got me all confused.<p>Here's the thing.
I am pretty sure he is NOT going to leave his job.
And I am the one who has coded everything in this product.
But the initial idea was his. IP is shared between both of us.<p>But if you ask me, he taught me everything related to this idea, and he has been helping me<p>through the worst of my times(I was in a coma, horrible horrible stuff happened to me,and he<p>agreed to give me a chance and guide me , believed in me, when i was almost broke...so....u<p>know...he is like...i don;t know, if you divide god into half....one half....well whatever,<p>that's another long story...maybe later)<p>He is not bringing in any coding to the company, though we always talk through all features of<p>the product and decide it. He is not an MBA, he is more like a head of dept now. He has opened 2<p>startups, he has so much more experience, he is a brilliant guy and i feel so lucky for even<p>being able to work with him. He is like one of the gods of his field. 
But we haven't decided roles specifically yet. 
And someone said that his offer of the whole 50-50 is unfair and all.<p>Now, I am confused here.
What do people do when one of the co founders is technical, but he is more like an abstract<p>adviser, still a top guy in his field in academics?
and in this case,he is not even going to work  full time for the company.
but he is like eric schmidt in some sense, that he actually manages a lot of stuff in his<p>current position (u knw, like eric was working for google and apple until recently, and like he<p>was a chairman for quite some time with google, before he switched over to google as CEO back<p>then).<p>I am not even sure at this point exactly what his role would be. 
I just know what it won't be.
Also, his name and reputation follows him.
Having him on my side is really good.<p>Just that I don't know how to make sure I don't feel like a fool later on.
Coz I have read everywhere, it's better to settle all co founders issues from the very beginning<p>and better put things on paper.<p>So, I see these as his plus points:
1. Co-inventor of the technology.
2. Great Mentor.
3. Great qualifications.
4. Experience.
5. Good contacts.
6. Highly Technical guy.<p>And the minus:
1. I am considerably younger, so getting a buddy like feeling is almost impossible.
2. I might feel like I am working alone until I get some developers as employees, which might<p>take time since we have the product ready to sell.
3. Not a coder. 
4. Not full time employee, more like a partner who runs other stuff as well.<p>I am dying to hear from you guys on this.",,"{785208,784640,784542}",,5,Incorporation and stock sharing dilemma,6

4185795,,comment,joering2,2012-07-01 20:15:05,"I mentioned it on HN somewhere before that I think it would be nice to have a Drudge weekly news recap for all of us who don't have time to track DrudgeReport on a daily basis, and in my opinion, DR is an awesome place to find news as much unbiased as possible :)<p>So here it is. Let me know what you think. An example/last issue is here: [1]<p>Developer notes:<p>Environment: simple PHP/MySQL, no framework. Any development issues: not too much. The new thing I learnt is how tricky Gmail and Yahoo webmail are in regards to HTML emails. For example: GMail will replace black links with blue ones; both ""color: #000000"" and ""color: black"" will get stripped away. Hackerish solution: set the color to ""#000001"" and you good to go. Yahoo will overwrite links even nastier: both with their own colors and will apply their Ads for keywords in your links (it puts additional dashed blue line underneath your links). Hackerish solution: overwrite their ""yshortcuts"" class in all tags: span, div and a. Generally, webmail providers do not like when you apply any styles to links. To make sure you tried your best, apply your style in multiple tags, like this &#60;div style=""your style""&#62;&#60;a href="""" style=""your style""&#62;&#60;span style=""your style""&#62;&#60;font style=""your style""&#62;link&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/div&#62; . This will increase your chances of getting your links the way you want them to look. I haven't tested with Hotmail or AOL and frankly I am scared of doing so, but will play with it soon. Also always use tables (still love them) to format your content (or rather should say: to force formatting).<p>Algorithm notes:<p>There is no secret sauce, per say. I monitor Drudge in 5-minutes periods and capture basic info: article name, link, position, photo, etc. I monitor first and last changes for a day, since Matt does not work 24/7 :) At the end of the week (Friday 6pm est) I analyze the links pool (fri-fri) per column, and pickup only the ones that spend ""enough"" amount of minutes/hours on the site. Then review results and pickup the most interesting (I've been Drudge constant reader for about 5 years now) and organize links in easy to read flow of news. As you can see in the last issue [1], I try to presume links and photos' outlook in original way, and try to interfere into UX as little as I can. Note that this is a week old project, with just one issue sent out. I welcome all your thoughts, suggestions, etc.<p>Advertising notes:<p>I tried some paid tweets but since the users that are willing to sell those usually tweet about music, girls and fun stuff, I got very little clicks. I run a simple CPM campaign on Facebook and while click-through rates are obviously low (0.01%), the remaining fact is that 90% of people that click and went to the site end up signing up. I think it's a huge success; unfortunately the CTR rates for FB are low, because people go there to watch friends' photos and post status updates, not to look on ads. Personally, I unconsciously trained myself not to look at the spots where ads are. So even with conversion rates of 90%, the 50 cents per CPM I still end up paying $1 per signed user. Too much.<p>Marketing notes: this one I left out to you. I am mostly a computer programmer and lack knowledge on advertising an online newsletter like this one. Any help from your side as to how I can build a DrudgeNewsletter userbase will be appreciated. With very good conversion rates on FB, I plan to put some money into advertising it, so if you have a vehicle that you think I should take advantage of in regards to spreading the word, please definitely let me know.<p>[1] <a href=""http://drudgenewsletter.com/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drudgenewsletter.com/latest/</a>",4185785,,,,,

2336318,,comment,grellas,2011-03-17 15:06:22,"The issue is a due process one under the U.S. Constitution. The law does not deem it fair to sue someone in a remote jurisdiction with which the defendant has no connection and, if a defendant is improperly sued in such a place, he can have the case dismissed on the technical ground that the court has no legitimate authority over him to be able to act on the case. If a court hears such a challenge, and grants it, it will dismiss the case ""without prejudice"" to its being refiled in a proper jurisdiction. In other words, such a dismissal does not determine the merits of the case but only whether it has been brought in a proper court.<p>The constitutional analysis on this issue turns on whether a person has what are called ""minimum contacts"" with a given state such that the law deems it fair and reasonable to require that person to have to appear to defend an action there (there is an alternative specialty form of jurisdiction called ""in rem"" jurisdiction that deals with property but the foregoing pertains to the all-encompassing area of ""jurisdiction over the person"" or ""personal jurisdiction""). To establish proper jurisdiction in a given state, the party suing must show that a person being sued is either <i>generally</i> ""present"" in that state (i.e., lives there or, if an entity, is domiciled there or conducts regular business there) or, alternatively, that such person had sufficient contacts with that state concerning the transaction over which he is being sued so as to make it fair to sue him there with respect to that transaction only. If either general jurisdiction (the first type) or limited jurisdiction (the second) is shown, then someone can be sued in a given state. Of course, as an individual, if you are sued under general jurisdiction, that means you are being sued where you live. However, if you are sued under a theory of limited jurisdiction, you can be sued in a place that is remote from where you live (a ""remote forum,"" in legal parlance) provided only that the court deems it fair under a minimum-contacts analysis. Once jurisdiction is determined to be proper, a defendant sued in a distant forum can still attempt to get the case transferred to a place that is more convenient for him to defend in and that analysis then invokes a separate legal doctrine called ""forum non conveniens"" by which a court further assesses whether, among the range of forums over which a case might technically be brought, which is the most convenient and appropriate one given practical factors such as where most of the activity in dispute occurred, where people live, and the like.<p>So, from a fairness standpoint, anyone sued in a distant forum can fight on two fronts, jurisdiction and forum convenience. He makes what is called a ""limited appearance"" to challenge jurisdiction without agreeing to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court for purposes of making that challenge. If he wins, the court dismisses the case while allowing the party to refile in a proper forum; if he loses, then the court has jurisdiction unless he can change the result through an emergency appeal. Once jurisdiction is so established, then any action of the court is binding on the defendant and any judgment entered can be enforced against him in that jurisdiction or in any other state in the U.S. (which will give ""full faith and credit"" to the judgment under prevailing U.S. law).<p>If you are sued in a remote forum, and you do not ""specially appear"" to challenge jurisdiction once you are served with the summons and complaint, then the party will take a default judgment against you. When the party comes to your state to ask a court to enforce the judgment against you, you can seek to set that judgment aside even at that stage on grounds that the original court lacked proper jurisdiction over your person and so was constitutionally incompetent to enter that judgment. If you win on such an argument, the judgment is unenforceable and void; if you lose, of course, then the judgment is enforced against you and, since you defaulted in the original action, you have no defense to it unless you can return to the originating jurisdiction and seek to set it aside on whatever grounds they permit for setting aside a default judgment. Since it is usually very difficult to set aside default judgments, it normally behooves a party who has been sued in a remote forum to hire counsel to challenge the jurisdiction right up front via a ""special appearance"" rather than letting a judgment go by default in hopes of challenging it later at the enforcement stage in your local jurisdiction.<p>All that said, what is happening in the <i>Sony</i> case is that the individual defendant appeared specially to say that the federal court in the Northern District of California (i.e., San Francisco) lacks jurisdiction over his person under minimum-contacts analysis and should therefore dismiss Sony's case without prejudice to its being refiled in the place in which he lives. Sony is arguing that sufficient minimum contacts do exist with the San Francisco forum such as to make it fair and reasonable to require the defendant to appear to defend the case there.<p>Once the issue is so joined, a federal court will normally allow a party such as Sony to conduct limited discovery tailored to determining facts relevant to the jurisdictional question only. Since the main issue concerning jurisdiction concerning what ""contacts"" the defendant had with the San Francisco forum relating to the underlying actions over which he is being sued, it becomes technically relevant for the suing party to attempt to find all such contacts. That would be the legal basis upon which the court is permitting this sort of subpoena to be enforced.<p>Why San Francisco? I assume this is less for the purpose of harassing the defendant as such than it is for that of having the case heard in a forum in which the judges are likely far more knowledgeable about Silicon Valley-style legal issues than they might be elsewhere.<p>This sort of high-profile fight, by the way, is wildly expensive to conduct and, I assume, the defendant is only able to do so because of donations from others or because of volunteer efforts by organizations who specialize in defending the rights here being attacked.<p>I hope this helps explain the relevant legal issues (sorry for the length but I clerked for a federal judge in the Northern District of California many years back and it fell to the sorry lot of the law clerks to research these exact issues many times over during one's stint with the court).",2335698,{2337330},,,,

The reason is if there is another gem which requires a gem that does not match the requirement of the latest version of Rails, it will backtrack until it finds a compatible version across the board.<p>So you will want to double-check the specific version that you end up with.

4835171,,comment,chimeracoder,2012-11-27 01:46:26,"&#62; Just goes to show that there is usually a huge difference between what we think of historical figures and how they actually were.<p>It shows that people are complicated and multifaceted. While we have a tendency to either laud or vilify figures (with nothing in between), in reality, historical figures can be both ""good"" and ""bad"" in different aspects of their lives... just like the rest of us.<p>My favorite example of this is Helen Keller[1]. Almost nobody these days knows anything about Helen Keller beyond the age of 18 - they know that learned to communicate despite being deaf and blind, but the nearly 70 years of her life <i>after</i> that are almost buried in history.<p>Which is a shame, because Helen Keller would have been a notable figure in her own right even if it weren't for her disability[2].<p>But because she was a member of the official Socialist party, we can't use her story as an inspirational lesson <i>and</i> mention that she held political beliefs that we may or may not agree with. Instead have to make a judgement call as to whether her ""good"" or her ""bad[3]"" side is more important to teach, and then forget about the rest.<p>Worse, this principle is applied in reverse to dehumanize people whom history has classified as villains. The result is that our history is filled with monochromatic caricatures, and we forget that, were we to see the complete picture, our modern-day ""villains"" may not look so different (for better or for worse!)<p>[1] I believe Loewen talks about this in his excellent book <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me</a>)<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller#Political_activities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller#Political_activiti...</a><p>[2] Naturally, this presumes that you either disagree with socialist politics or think that history lessons should be politically neutral, which is the predominant belief in the USA.",4835083,"{4835457,4835664}",,,,

But the algorithm is over a 1000 lines split up into perhaps 50 20-line functions, and it's mysterious how the whole works by looking at the parts.<p>I have one particular piece of code, that I wrote, in mind. It was to implement anonymous methods in the Delphi compiler. Given an AST for a method from the parser, it had to rewrite the tree to turn captured local variable references into field accesses on a heap-allocated stack frame, turn anonymous methods into methods on this heap-allocated stack frame, and all while minimizing the number of passes over the tree. And this has to work recursively, which adds a surprising number of wrinkles about the ordering in which you can do things.<p>So for example any given pass may be building up accounting data needed by later passes. This is somewhat mysterious, because it seems like busywork; and why is it doing this here? Why not fold one pass into another? Why not move work between passes? Well, the subtle ordering problems are not clear at all when you're looking at things at the function level. You can only understand the pieces when you already understand the whole.<p>And this is why there is a very long comment block describing how this stuff works. Because figuring it out by reading the code is too expensive.<p>(That ~1000 lines of code took perhaps 4 months to write; having to integrate with rest of a large complex codebase adds countless more wrinkles.)",4934758,,,,,

Myspace, Twitter, Facebook, and now YouTube have been bitten by it, some multiple times. My point is, with so much social content being user-generated, there is absolutely no way to wall-off the user-content easily. You have to manually make sure every piece of user data is parsed and filtered, and most developers do that but it's not easy.<p>Show me the code that allows users to enter basic HTML (&#60;a&#62;, &#60;b&#62;, &#60;p&#62;, &#60;u&#62;) while preventing the bad stuff (&#60;script&#62;, &#60;body&#62;). Now make this code allow &#60;a&#62; to have attributes like href, title but not onclick, onmouseout. Allow &#60;p&#62; to have style attributes for font-family but not width:expression(400 + ""px"") style because that's another way to run JS in IE. You'll quickly see how it gets difficult really quick.<p>The solution for most sites (including reddit/HN) is to use Markdown. It's not a perfect solution but it works for sites where data entry is restricted to a few fields. YouTube is so large and has so many places where users can enter arbitrary data that it is not simple to ensure there are no bugs anywhere.<p>Again, I don't understand how my solution (a) fails in preventing all XSS hacks that we've seen so far. Each hack worked because users could insert JS code into a form that was not properly filtered. What is harder? Making sure every single web form on the Internet has 0 sanitization bugs or adding a single meta-tag to top browsers that says ""Hey, don't run any inline JS.""",1485835,"{1485919,1485925}",,,,

The more successful companies buck this trend, the more likely non-VC companies are to get considered for acquisition down the road, and the more likely said companies are to be able to drum up press for an IPO, as well.",4084305,,,,,

Electric vehicles use NiMH batteries (0.25 MJ/kg), lithium batteries (0.4 to 0.7 MJ/kg) or lead acid (0.14 MJ/kg fork trucks, but they need mass anyway).<p>Guessing at the numbers MIT is avoiding naming in that press release, they might get to something three times better than the current lithium batteries, but you also have to add in the mass of the pumps, and the reaction part of the battery.<p>It could ""win"", but it won't be a game changer.<p>Putting aside vehicles though, flow batteries have some interesting properties for utility scale energy storage. The rate at which you can store or retrieve energy is independent from the amount of energy you can store. The first is by the size of your reactor, the second is by the volume of your storage tanks. It is possible if they are using common enough elements for their fluid that they could be a good answer for peak load shifting or production storing.",2634697,{2634843},,,,

2634796,,comment,barrkel,2011-06-08 21:07:59,"I cannot agree. There are so many ""facts"" that the mere selection of which ones get recorded already puts an overwhelming bias on the stories they tell. History is obsessed with narratives, and there is an ineluctable requirement, when doing history, to create a story where earlier ""facts"" leads to later ""facts"" in a hypothesis of cause and effect. The requirement for a pseudo-logical story with internal consistency further cherry-picks the ""facts"", until you're left with a complete bowdlerization of reality. The truth is, there are enough ""facts"" that you can very probably tell a whole lot of different stories using the raw material, but people have a very strong disinclination to cognitive dissonance and won't do this. They'll pick one and stick with it, and argue it against other stories in ego-driven battles, until a consensus emerges as a sociological phenomenon, rather than a fact-driven one.<p>One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. Criminals often think they're justified in the actions they take; in fact, often they must self-justify their own actions in order to sleep at night at all, so they will have their own internally consistent narratives. It's extremely difficult to fight the dominant narrative once it has become accepted.<p>IMO, the highest value history has is in telling stories about a world which is different from our own, but for which we have somewhat believable evidence actually existed. The degrees to which it is different tell us what varies in human nature, and what stays the same, stays the same. It teaches us to not take the present moment too seriously as some kind of apex or nadir. But I don't think it <i>actually</i> tells us a whole lot about the past, per se.",2634027,,,,,

Rather, the way the breeder expresses his preferences is to SELECT the traits he is looking for. The only understanding required to see how this works in the case of natural selection is to see that nature analogously 'selects' some things over others, without intelligence on nature's part. In other words, the breeder is a ""fitness landscape"" for his captive pigeons. The natural fitness landscape may not choose the same things as a pigeon fancier would, but it does 'choose' some things like traits involved in surviving to breeding age, attracting mates, having sufficiently  many healthy children, etc. Although it is natural, it is still selection.<p>This is not ""intelligent evolutive design"" just because a human being is involved in the experiment.

Well, living people that is, as you do need the books of long deceased thinkers. (I'd say this also applies to philosophy, and hardly anything else). You just need to be willing to spend enormous amounts of time alone in contemplation reading.<p><i>The sole cause of man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his room.</i><p>— Blaise Pascal<p>There's also a very limited social component layer such as you would find in medicine, law, politics, economics, et al. To become a doctor, or any kind of ""professional"", sure, it requires a massive social apparatus on top of a high degree of actual learning. You have to have connections, know the right people, say the right and popular things to them, be supported and credentialed by the leadership and their agenda, and basically imposture one's self into mimicking whatever behaviors and traits are specific to and dominant in whatever professional field you're studying. Eventually your identity morphs into this set of learned behaviors, and it's almost entirely built upon your position in some type of social hierarchy.<p>Not so with math. You either know some theorem and the proof, or you don't. How much you know and how advanced you are is <i>entirely</i> dependent upon what you have worked through on your own. What new stuff you can create only comes from what old stuff you already know. None of this has anything to do with interacting with people. Sure, you can benefit by talking to other mathematicians, attending lectures, conferences, teaching others, etc, but at the end of the day, at some point, you still have to sit down and <i>learn</i> the material by yourself. And if you don't do that, it doesn't matter how much of a social butterfly you are—you can't be a mathematician.<p><i>No man is an island</i>, but I imagine a Robinson Crusoe type figure would have no such problems becoming a mathematician on a desert island, given enough math books(<i>and some kind of Internet connection</i>).",1820764,{1821476},,,,

The more things change, the more you need to test and retest to be <i>absolutely</i> sure that those changes didn't have any unintended side-effects. This is why, in the process of reaching a GM build, the ability for groups to change components is gradually locked down. The final lock-down is GM, and this usually happens around 1 month before the first customers see the next OS. This time is needed to ""prime the channel"". That is: you need to press the disks, prepare the marketing material and the packaging, do all of the final validation testing, and start shipping the software to stores.<p>In the case of SnowLeopard, that meant that development was done, and GM was declared, in the 3rd week of July. SnowLeopard shipped on Aug. 28th.

Higher compression ratios are a great way of squeezing more power out of the same amount of gasoline, but raising the compression ratio also raises the risk of detonation.<p>Detonation occurs when the pressure and temperature inside the cylinder cause the air-fuel mixture to literally detonate, rather than burn (relatively) slowly and evenly as desired. If this occurs before the spark, it is called pre-ignition. When it occurs after the spark, while the flame front is progressing through the cylinder, it is referred to as detonation. Higher octane fuels are more resistant to detonation and pre-ignition, and usually go hand-in-hand with higher compression ratios.<p>As a side note, E85 Ethanol has a ridiculously high octane rating, among other things, which allows for higher compression ratios and much higher boost in forced-induction engines. I keep hoping E85 will catch on outside of the corn belt so I can effectively get race gas performance from pump gas in my turbocharged motor, but no such luck yet.<p>There are plenty of tricks that can be played to reduce the risk of detonation using low-octane fuels in high compression motors. Efficient head design with excellent cooling will reduce cylinder temperatures and minimize hot spotting within the cylinder head, reducing the risks of detonation and pre-ignition. Getting the heat out of the valves is particularly challenging as they only meet the cylinder head in a relatively small contact patch. The valves can be filled with sodium, which turns to liquid as the motor reaches operating temperature and circulates within the valve, cooling the valve and further reduce hot spots (pre-ignition points) within the motor. Also, designing the piston and head to thoroughly mix and swirl the intake charge helps create a quick, even, clean burn.<p>However, to get up to 14:1 on a production motor, I wonder if Mazda is playing serious games with the intake camshaft timing to reduce the effective compression ratio. If you leave the intake valves open long enough after the piston begins the compression stroke, it will actually push a tiny amount of air back out of the intake valves, reducing the effective compression ratio of the motor at top dead center. With variable valve timing, Mazda could just be doing this near full load, where detonation and pre-ignition are problems. At partial load, you can get away with much higher compression ratios (up to 20:1 in certain cases, IIRC) with associated increases in efficiency (and thus higher MPG).<p>Either way, I'm glad to see more efficient internal combustion engines. The internal combustion engine is a 100+ year old technology, so significant improvements are hard to come by without drastically increasing the cost of the motor. Good stuff.",1820085,{1821494},,,,

People bought a game for their Atari at home because they'd played it in an upright at the arcade a few years earlier.<p>Then, Nintendo came in with Super Mario Bros and said, hey, there's a whole different paradigm we can work with here.

Find someone else whose Rails skills you find are roughly comparable to yours, and say you are too booked to commit to sling the code for them, but you would be happy to serve in a technical advisory / oversight capacity as a board member, and here's this other Rails coder who should be able to serve your needs almost as well. Typical board member time commitment is no more than 16 hours a month for a director who is conscientious, with no chair commitments on a board, but one who preps for the board meetings, is available for ad-hoc and committee meetings, etc. Typical compensation is entirely equity, around 2% at the pre-seed stage for each director. Read up on what board of directors do in a startup if you take this advice and use it, before you approach them; don't go overboard, an evening spent Googling around is sufficient at your stage with these guys, you just need to get a feel for the boundary between guidance / advice and operations.<p>This delivers several objectives:<p>* Puts out the message: your professional time is outbidding their bid in the market.
* Retain the relationship for a more manageable time commitment.
* Allows them to get strategic-level technical advice from you ""for free"" (for now), and implement in the trenches as they see fit.
* Gives them a starting point for another in the trenches implementer.<p>Expertise matters <i>a lot</i>. Execution matters more.<p>It can cost very little to offer general board-level guidance (making sure they are asking the right questions) using your expertise if like in your situation you are favorably disposed to the parties. It should cost very dear for you to use your expertise to execute.",3298325,,,,,

If you want to open one, just put the mouse over it and lift.<p>Something that didn't get much press but which is unique and wonderful to use is the integration between the filesystem and the UI. Email messages are just files that sit in a directory, but the tracker exposes attributes to them, and you can have it display columns for 'From' and 'Subject'. Your inbox is just a folder that contains your mail messages. There's an instant message client that works along  these lines too. Users are just files, and the IM functionality is a plugin engine to the tracker. This feels connected to the 'everything is a file' philosophy.<p>The OSX filesystem is technically capable of some of this stuff (written by the same guy, and later, so it's probably a lot better), but the finder isn't. So even though OSX is probably superior internally, in practice it isn't better to use.<p>There's a library called bethon that exposes the internals of the OS to python. I've used this with success in the past, not recently. It used to be the case that you could use a combination of the C++ BeBook dev but then piece stuff together from the python console.<p>Update: Got bethon working. It's a bit of a fiddle in this VM because there's limited disk space available, and sed isn't linked in /bin. But once you get it built the example at <a href=""http://donn.drizzlehosting.com/Bethex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donn.drizzlehosting.com/Bethex.html</a> works fine.",1335695,{1336080},,,,

I was smart at the time, and so I tended to spend most of my social time hanging out with folks who were 5-10 years older and absorbed a lot of culture from them. I've always identified more with the ""ideals"" of Generation X than with those of the Millenial generation or Generation Y. I'm cynical almost to a fault. I have extreme problems accepting un-earned authority, such that my wife said ""you just aren't meant to have a boss"" the other day. I really just want to be left alone to live my life in peace, like a less violent Daniel Plainview.<p>To get meta, I think that it's probably easiest to envision generations as phases of an ideological sine wave. At any given time, one set of ideas and culture - one phase - will be dominant and will contain most of the population. However, no phase ever dies out completely - there's always a few oddballs who will find medieval chivalry, for instance, appealing.

Losing weight is a simple mathematical equation.  Burn 2500 calories a day, and eat 2000, and every week you will lose 1 pound (1 pound ~ 3500 calories).  The difficult part is making it happen on a daily basis.  Say your body burns 2200 calories a day...can you squeeze in 45 minutes of intense cardio each day to burn another 300?  On top of that, can you restrict your calorie intake to 2000 when a typical fast food combo is 1100 calories and a Starbucks latte is 190?  There is even a salad on CPK's menu that weighs in at a whopping 1800 calories.  I think the problem with losing weight, especially in the United States, is not a matter of math, it is a matter of discipline.  If you are American and you want to lose weight, I suggest moving to Japan.  I have been there twice, and I lose an average of 5 pounds a week there because of a diet heavy on rice and seafood, but with extremely small portions, lots of walking, dancing til 5am, and lots of pushing on crowded trains.",3236161,"{3236266,3236263,3236226}",,,,

Yes, if you are getting less than 1% of a startup, and making a big sacrifice for that startup, then the sacrifice may not make any sense.<p>Ellen Beldner does the same thing, in the indirectly linked article. She writes:<p>""Senior engineers / VPs / early directors may get somewhere between 50 and 150 basis points (0.5 - 1.5%).""<p>Those are very small amounts of equity. Such small amounts do not make sense if the idea of the startup is utterly unproven. It is valid to criticize those amounts, but the conclusion should be that early employees should get larger stakes.<p>For the first 3 or 4 people working with a startup, I agree with you that they should be working on ""their"" startup. And that is the point of equity - to make it theirs. But clearly, early on, with the idea unproven, the equity stakes need to more like 10% or 20% rather than less than 1%. Give someone 10% - 20% of the company and then they are doing what you suggest: the only startup worth working on is your own. They are substantial owners at that point (10% to 20%).<p>And yes, the equity stakes will get diluted later on, if the company is successful, but that is fine, since that is such a great problem to have to worry about - it means you've been successful.<p>Right now, I'm trying to get friends to work with me on my startup. The shares we are considering are all in the 5% to 10% range, rather than the less than 1% range.

Filing 1099s was really easy.  If I had to, I could probably even do it retrospectively to meet this &#62;$600 requirement without breaking a sweat: my business credit card aggregated all yearly purchases by merchant and by category.  It would be a simple matter of looking at my year-end statement as all my business expenses were paid with that account.  Also, the most basic Quicken-like accounting packages offer the same functionality.  If there are market gaps for simple software (or bank statement reporting) they will be filled quickly.  So I think this is much ado about a very small problem.<p>Still, there's a good chance the opposition to this relatively minor reporting requirement will force it to be repealed.  If it does go into effect, I would expect the IRS to offer better automated filing for 1099s if for no other reason than to make their own jobs easier.<p>I have trouble believing those who complain so loudly about this requirement (thread parent excluded) because so often they are opposed to the health care legislation on other grounds.  On balance, this health care law is designed to be a huge net positive for small businesses-- in addition to new tax credits to help them pay their employees' premiums, for the first time there will be public group policies available in the new health care exchanges with real competition.  Costs should go <i>down</i> for small businesses, <i>significantly.</i>  Doing a couple hours of extra accounting each year pales in comparison to these benefits.",1785002,{1785455},,,,

530010,,comment,trjordan,2009-03-24 12:09:34,"I take issue with his argument that the free market punishes those who take code close sourced. The fundamental problem with open-source development is that it's always designed by committee. In most cases, this produces cleaner, faster, more robust code, but it's not true in every case. Open-source code has this tendency to get the basics right before improving the user experience, but if the standards and basics are fuzzy, the product never gets polished. Take OpenOffice - by trying to both copy MS and improve MS, it's no wonder the entire thing is a big bloated mess.<p>Some others have mentioned Apple as a counter-example, and I think they're dead on. By allowing BSD to be close-source forked, the market provided the economic incentive to allow Apple to run with it. They could then close a lot of the difficulties in an OS (arbitrary hardware setups, unwillingness to couple strongly to applications, etc.), and they've made an incredible product out of it. Philosophically, open-source would never make anything like OS X, because of the amount of vertical integration.<p>There isn't always incentive to move a project back to closed-source, and it's hard to argue that it's a long term strategy, but you can't say that the market universally crushes projects that aren't open-source.",529822,{530096},,,,

In simplistic terms, it means making fixed ""FCC style"" spectrum management largely obsolete, by pairing each radio transmitter with a receiver.  The receiver is used to monitor the surrounding radio environment, and the system makes a determination, in real-time, of what (if anything) it can transmit whilst avoiding interference with other users of the spectrum.<p>Cognitive radio offers the potential for large increases in data capacity since the radio spectrum is currently underutilised.  I was at a conference a few years ago, where a presenter had done the measurements, and the utilisation of the radio spectrum (averaged across time and frequency) was about 5%.  It turns out that most licensees hardly, if ever, transmit.<p>There's currently a regulatory push to allow others to use a chunk of spectrum, as long as they don't interfere with the licensee, meaning the licensee gets guaranteed access, rather than exclusive access.  It should be interesting, since it will open the (cheaper?) alternative of buying smarter radios instead of buying spectrum.",5185563,"{5187736,5187102}",,,,

635298,,comment,iigs,2009-06-01 02:08:36,"Hello. A lot of your early years sound very similar to mine: Liked computers, grew up in a place where nobody knew/cared about them, was smart but never worked very hard, got by in school but never excelled. I lucked out and knew a professor that knew someone and when I dropped out of college I left for industry and have been able to keep inertia up to where I am. My advice:<p>1) Keep Moving. If I only had two words to tell you it would be those. You're behind the eight-ball as far as education, math in particular, goes but you can fix that... but it's not going to fix itself. Take any other classes you can in parallel but Just. Don't. Stop. What you're looking at as an crushing, insurmountable mountain of work is really only a few years.<p>2) Get a degree in a field you care about and can find work in. The school doesn't really matter. The old ""just get the piece of paper"" advice is generally considered deprecated, but you <i>do</i> need to have the skills. Unless you go somewhere that is actively known for its bad program (and even then that's only likely to be known locally) it will be a net positive.<p>3) Attempt to seek out people that are smarter and more curious than you are. I can relate to your high school experience, and I don't have a lot of hopeful to say about the people that stayed in the town I grew up in. Always keep your eyes open, though; you may find people that seem smart at first that don't seem like it after you see their weaknesses.<p>4) The ""cities full of intelligence and ambition"" thing is romantic but won't pay the bills. Be on the lookout for cities that have a solid economy and job opportunities for people with your skills and education. I suspect you'll do better more toward the west than the (north-)east, but I don't know much about the south-east. You may be better off right now than you know.<p>5) Use your desire to learn about geek stuff (SICP, Python, et. al.) to feed your general sense of curiosity, and your ""technical taste"" but don't bank on it for preparation for entrepreneur-hood. {major dissenting opinion ahead} I believe that people searching for the next big thing in the fields of the last big thing are generally wasting their time. Too bad for me (and possibly you) this industry is what I love. Tech is a great industry to be working in, but every big thing started with an itch to scratch.<p>Good luck!",635192,{635498},,,,

My setup includes 2x 27&quot; monitors with an ErgoTron arm, two macbooks and a desktop stashed on the side.<p>I do a lot of Dev work as well as design. When I&#x27;m coding, standing isnt too much of an issue. Having the option of moving around helps me when I&#x27;m stuck debugging issues. When designing though, especially with a wacom tablet, I notice that I tend to slouch or lean too much on the desk, so I sit.<p>Having a motor makes it very convenient for lazy people like me, especially if it has presets. Setting up the height to make it ergonomically correct is key.<p>I have a friend that has a DIY setup who uses monitors which adds to the weight and makes adjusting the height on demand very inconvenient–leading to the fact that he doesnt use it to stand anymore. If you go the DIY route, make sure its setup correctly. I&#x27;ve seen some creative setups before including putting a height adjustable chair on their desk. I was too short for that to work for me.<p>In regards to long-term work, that all depends on you. Like most people on HN, my days run 8~12 hours too. When I first got my desk, I split my day up until I got used to it. One of the things that helped was the use of a GelPro mat (check the clearance section) which cushions your feet.<p>There are days I&#x27;ve stood all day and felt fine. When I&#x27;m sitting I tend to get myself into &quot;Stuck to the chair&quot; mode and even if all it takes is to stand up to walk around to get your blood flowing, I dont or I dont even realize I&#x27;ve been glued to the chair for hours on end.<p>Hope that helps.",6084272,,,,,

then I did my own start up, I bootstrapped a SaaS antispam service as a single founder/sole employee company based around open source with a custom frontend written in PHP/MySQL.
It had ~2000 companies using the system when I sold it. But I didn't have many direct clients, it was almost all through a network of resellers I built up to insulate me from having support issues from users
kill all of my time. On top of that I did freelance web dev work in PHP/MySQL.
I sold that business a few years back and went back to college to do study law.
I became a father while completing my studies and so I decided to take more time out to hang out with my son while I could afford it.<p>Now I have wound down the funds from my old business, I want to get back working and be a part of something.<p>The problem is that I'm not really good with the things that are current. Everything now is virtualization, ruby, node.
I haven't been exposed much to these things, even things like Nagios, I didn't use that in my business, I just wrote scripts which sent me an SMS based on certain criteria. 
One recruiter told me that's no good, their client wants Nagios experience.
Even my PHP ability isn't the best, I write everything as functions, and job descriptions want OOP. 
Any job I see is looking for people who are specialists, I'm not a specialist, in the guy who is too stubborn to give up and eventually figures the thing out.<p>I have also found out that HR have blocked applications I have made because of the gap in my work/employment history, I sold my business in late 2008, so I can see how late 2008 to
early 2012 would be an issue from a HR perspective.<p>I am thinking of doing the RHCE as a way to verify to perspective employers that I do currently have an ability to manage Linux systems, I figure some sort of third party validation would
help hiring managers get over the career break.<p>Should I take a junior position and work my way back up the career path? Do I just keep applying for jobs with experience and work on explaining the employment gap?
I think me being rusty is also an issue after such a break, which negates slightly against me getting jobs with experience, at least so far that seems to be the case.
Do I start learning Ruby and write something to release as open source to show I can write Ruby code?
Maybe just giving up on getting hired and trying to bootstrap a business again from scratch is the way to go?<p>Has anybody else found themselves in a similar position after selling a start up? If so, what did you do at this point?<p>Apologies if this post comes across as complaining, that really isn't my intention. I'm just a little frustrated and not sure what direction I should take.",,"{3787995,3786430,3788112,3786633,3786599}",,11,"Post Startup Founder Feeling Lost, Career Advice Appreciated",6

4986005,,comment,ircmaxell,2012-12-30 15:51:34,"I'm the author of this library. I figured I'd answer a couple of questions as to <i>why</i> I wrote this.<p>First, it was something that I always wanted to do. For no particular reason other than I wanted to do it. I knew it was possible, but possible and doing it are two very different things.<p>Second, it was far easier than I thought. The time to the initial commit (basic working VM) was only about 6 hours of work. So it's not like I spent a year building it...<p>Third, it could be a useful education tool. For me learning the intricacies of the Zend VM better (I know it fairly well, but knowing and building give two different amounts of knowledge). But also for teaching others how the VM works. By giving a PHP implementation reference, hopefully more people can understand how the C implementation works (they both operate off the same generic implementation at this point).<p>Fourth, it can enable certain interesting things. For example, we could hypothetically build an Opcode optimizer in PHP which parses the generated opcodes and optimizes things (removing redundant opcodes, statically compiling static expressions, etc). Then, we could build a PECL extension that would render those optimized opcodes directly into APC cache (or some other opcode cache mechanism).<p>Fifth, it can be used to quickly mock up future functionality changes. Consider that it's easier to alter a PHP VM simply because you don't need to worry about memory management at all. So whipping up a POC for a significant feature should be a lot easier in PHP than C (at least for many non-full-time C developers).<p>Sixth, it can be used to actually debug PHP code without working knowledge of GDB (and the underlying C structures). I wouldn't recommend this, as the chances of us getting it working 100% the same as the C implementation are practically 0, but it's a concept.<p>Seventh, it could wind up becoming a full implementation (like PYPY). If we can compile the implementation using HipHop, and do some other lower-level tricks, there's a chance we could achieve performance somewhere near the C implementation. I doubt it, but it's possible. Especially if we add a JIT component (or a way of rendering out to machine code certain opcodes)...<p>Eighth, why not?",4985834,"{4986653,4988398,4986101,4986148,4986147,4986474}",,,,

This is because it is much harder and unconfortable to sail close to the wind (that is at a small angle to the wind, say 45 degrees) than it is to sail downwind (with the wind behind you) or reaching (with the wind from the side of the boat).

      the_man = x
      break
</code></pre>
mary knows the_man<p>we can do something like<p><pre><code>  mary knows men.select { |x| john saw x }

namely, relative clauses: ""mary knows the man that john saw"".<p>But relative clauses are difficult to process when they're not tail recursive (think of The House that Jack Built in English vs. Japanese, let's say).<p>So what it might suggest is that the brain is a functional tail-call optimized system, rather than generically imperative or generically functional.

Ask around to find out who the exceptional professors are-- you'll find out, quickly-- and take whatever they are offering.  A good professor can make the dullest subject come to life; a bad professor can suck the life out of the most fascinating topic.<p>2) Treat studying as a job.  Set aside a couple of hours a day, preferably at a fixed time, to do focused, head-down, no nonsense studying.  I used a study carrel in the library, every day for two hours.  Two hours a day was all it took, to stay ahead of the pack in all subjects, and still have endless time for a very active social/extra-curricular life.",1885864,,,,,

We used (and still use) hacks on the web for desktop use when browsers sucked, and we'll do it on mobile devices, too.  It's the way the state-of-the-art is pushed forward; it's inevitable.  I think he would agree with me, seeing that he pointed out Scrollability's use on the iPad being somewhat valid.  That said, the author's underlying point examines <i>why</i> we use those hacks and to evaluate whether we're solving a non-existent problem.<p>Edit: I might clarify my hacks point.  The reason they're inevitable is that they sometimes expose browser deficiencies.  A current example would be web sockets. We've been using comet-type hacks in lieu of a real web socket solution (and Chrome has now implemented one).",2734461,,,,,

3435811,,comment,slowpoke,2012-01-07 01:18:31,"<i>&#62;You're stance on this takes away the rights of creators. The creator's rights are no less important than the consumer's rights.</i><p>My stance on the matter is that copyright takes away from the general public in the first place. It's not justified, and abolishing therefore means restoring it to the way it's supposed to be. Sorry, but I don't accept copyright as a given something whose abolishing we have to justify. On the contrary, the burden of proof lies on the advocates of copyright to show that it is justified to take away from the general public to hand a monopoly on non-scarce resources to private parties. And I am quite positive that it isn't.<p><i>&#62;Copying is not stealing technically but when something that is meant to be paid for gets copied and passed around free it does become stealing.</i><p>No, it isn't. Stealing has a strict definition: I take something away from you, which you lack afterwards. Copying involves no loss. No, not ""lost profits"" either. It's bullshit. Applying the word to copying is just a pathetic appeal to emotion.<p>Funnily enough, labeling us ""pirates"" in an attempt to villainize us has probably been the greatest thing the entertainment industry has ever done. It was adapted as a proud, if sometimes self-ironic label, and eventually spawned an entire political movement which now operates in pretty much all western countries with varying degrees of success.<p><i>&#62;Arguments about software being non-scarce don't apply.</i><p>Oh yes they do. Waving them aside like that doesn't change the fact that existing software is most definitely non-scarce. There's no limit on how much you can copy it. What you are talking about is the <i>creation of software</i>, which falls under the same category as claiming that without copyright, there would be no music.<p><i>&#62;Should authors only be paid for one copy of their book?</i><p>If you consider writing a book a service, then basically yes, s?he should be payed once. As every other artisan providing services is. There were even business models like that, with varying degrees of success (ask for sum $x, release book under public domain when $x is reached).<p><i>&#62;Why is it wrong to have a choice?</i><p>If that choice conflicts with reality, then no, you can't have a choice. And reality is that you cannot and should not be able to stop copying and sharing. It's pointless and largely impossible without extremely draconian measures, and, again, highly unethical to attempt to do so.<p>Oh, and you have quite a choice. You can either release your works and deal with the fact that they will be copied and shared - or you don't release anything.<p><i>&#62;so why is it that the anti-copyright crowd insists that creators should not have the choice to charge for what they create and should gladly give away their work for free.</i><p>But we are not. We're just saying you can't stop us from sharing. Those are two different, though related things. I can only refer you to the GPL as a good example for this: while you cannot demand access to source per se (and you <i>can</i> charge for a copy of the program if you do so choose), you cannot demand that others <i>stop</i> giving access (share) either. It's basically the golden rule. I cannot demand you to give me a copy of your program. Neither can you demand that I stop giving a copy I received from where-ever to other people. Your rights stop where mine begin. Copyright infringes on my right to share.<p><i>&#62;But at the same time I don't see a way for me, as a developer, to continue to make a living off my work in a world where it's legal for anyone to distribute my work freely against my wishes.</i><p>Well, that's a pity to heard but ultimately not of interest, as hard as it may sound. As I have said multiple times, distribution as a business model is <i>dead</i>. The horde of copyright-dependent zombies which are still crawling around are a danger to our future society and need to be put to rest as fast as possible. If you can't adapt and find new ways to make ends meet, then I'm afraid you will have to find a new job.",3434861,{3436537},,,,

6036472,,comment,akkartik,2013-07-13 03:39:46,"You got me thinking about how python differs from lisp in this respect, and the subtle way that a functional API has helped this specific situation.<p>While lisp suffers from the same &quot;definition is execution&quot; gotcha, the effects are far rarer in practice because () is immutable and interned while [] is mutable and usually generated afresh each time it&#x27;s executed.<p><pre><code>  $ python
  &gt;&gt;&gt; [] is []
  False

  $ sbcl
  * (eq () ())
  t
</code></pre>
Since [] is mutable, appends of [] can do superficially &#x27;the right thing&#x27;.<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt;&gt; a = []
  &gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(4)
  &gt;&gt;&gt; a
  [4]

  * (setq a ())
  * (nconc a &#x27;(34))
  (34)
  * a
  ()
</code></pre>
But there&#x27;s a reason lisp does seemingly the wrong thing. According to the spec, <i>nconc</i> skips empty arguments (<a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_nconc.htm#nconc"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lispworks.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;HyperSpec&#x2F;Body&#x2F;f_ncon...</a>) Reading between the lines, I&#x27;m assuming this makes sense from a perspective in lisp where we communicate even with &#x27;destructive&#x27; operations through their return value. This is more apparent when you consider <i>nreverse</i>:<p><pre><code>  * (setq a &#x27;(1 2 3 4))
  * (nreverse a)
  (4 3 2 1)
  * a
  (1)
</code></pre>
Destructive operations can reuse their input, but they&#x27;re not required to maintain bindings. There is no precise equivalent of python&#x27;s <i>.reverse()</i>. Instead, a common idiom is:<p><pre><code>  * (setq a (nreverse a))
</code></pre>
It seems like a weird design decision, but one upshot of it besides encouraging a more functional style is that this optional-arg gotcha loses a lot of its power in lisps. It&#x27;s very rare to define a default param of a non-empty list, and empty lists can&#x27;t be modified without assigning to them.",6034844,,,,,

Functions are objects same as everything else.  The &quot;def&quot; keyword is how you call the constructor for a function object.

You can configure all terminals to have the same history at the same time, but I have it set to add history to the .zsh_history file immediately, but each shell gets it's own history.  So ctrl-r in a shell lists commands entered into that shell (or preexisting when it started), and opening a new terminal starts with the shared history from all terminals.  This is really the best of both worlds.  Also there's a knob to only add a command if it isn't in the history, so no scrolling back over a dozen ""cd .."" or whatever.<p>Zsh has floating point math, for instance $((1.0/2)) is 0.5 instead of an error.

Every time the money changes hands, you can bet the insurance company takes it's share.<p>This model will allow (or even cause) drug companies and hospitals to keep costs high to protect reimbursements, all via back-room deals with huge insurance companies.

We see a typically less gullible set of subjects for these anecdotes, but that can unfortunately be explained entirely by the more plausible sounding hypothesis.<p>I&#x27;ll dispense with the full Bayesian treatment here, but what we have here is a case of the base rate fallacy (although not the form that is usually discussed): failing to account for the prior probability of the evidence. That is, we have some evidence, which is that the anecdotes we see are largely in favor of standing desks being helpful, and we need to account for how likely that evidence is <i>regardless</i> of whether standing desks <i>are</i> helpful.<p>Unfortunately, as our friends with the magnetic bracelets demonstrate, that probability turns out to be very high. If something works, we see overwhelmingly positive anecdotes. If it doesn&#x27;t work, we see overwhelmingly positive anecdotes.<p>Why might this be? Well, for one thing, there is sensitivity to placebo effects, because have purely qualitative phenomena that are being reported only subjectively.<p>But even stronger is a selection bias that has to do with people&#x27;s behavior in reporting and reading.

If instincts were truly passed on as memories, then they should be present throughout life and not appear when such evolutionary adaption is needed. This conflicts with evolutionary developmental psychological theory, which suggests that people face different survival adaptive problems at various points of their lifetime. For example, problems of survival as an infant must occur before problems of mating. Mating must predictably occur before parenting, and likewise before grand-parenting. From this, we expect certain &quot;instincts&quot; to appear and disappear as adaptive problems change. This is known to be true in infants: two examples are an infant&#x27;s ability to swim (which disappears after 6 months) and also the Moro reflex, a potentially lifesaving reflex that occurs while falling. If these were &quot;memories&quot; and not instincts, then they would not appear so rapidly nor so consistently.

For instance the level editor I wrote recently uses the human-readable text format when it saves out levels. But when I am ready to ship, I can trivially convert these level files to binary and immediately improve the performance of my app.<p>- Tons of language bindings. Our engine code base is C++, but any build scripts I write are done in Python and if my script needs to touch protobuf files I don't have to rewrite my file parsing routines -- it just works.<p>I looked into using Apache Thrift as well, but their text-based format is not human readable so it was a non-starter for us.",2834010,,,,,

Everyday, I learn about a new app, that allows me to solve a need that I have on my phone itself. For example, unless I need to send out a long e-mail, I don't bother signing into G-mail on my computer anymore. I have stopped checking to see if I have new mail multiple times  day. My phone buzzes and lets me know quite reliably. I don't log onto ""Reddit"" any more. When I have a few free minutes and want something to laugh about, I use the Reddit app on my phone. When I want to see how my sites are doing, I use the Google Analytics app. Basically, as I learn about more apps, I seem to be getting more and more of my problems solved on my phone itself. I am less inclined to turn on my computer unless I have to do actual work. But, since I work in technology, there is still a compelling need in my life that my computer solves.<p>On the other hand, lets talk about my Aunt. She has little or no association with technology. The only reason she uses her computer is to exchange email and chat with her kids on Skype. If her computer decided to disappear today, and she asked me what to buy....I would tell her to buy a nice Android phone. It can do everything she wants to achieve. A computer is an over-kill for her needs. The Android phone will be pretty, cheap, not take up space and have a much more manageable learning curve.<p>My point is simple, Google has made Android smart-phones something a lot of people can have. The Android apps ecosystem grows everyday. And each app, targets a particular need (in-theory). So, if in-theory, if I gave 100% of the people I know Android smartphones and taught them how to find and install apps, about 50% of the people I know would never feel the need to switch on their computers again. All the problems they solved with their computer, would be solved by these tiny apps that take a second to load and are quite pretty to look at.<p>The only people who would end up switching on their computer are the people who would have to do serious ""work"" or enjoy serious ""entertainment"".<p>THE POINT: By creating this app ecosystem and trying to get Android in everybody's hands has Google not solved people's problems too efficiently. So efficiently, that they don't need Google anymore other than to do ""hard core research"". Google makes the bulk of its money on transactional queries, and if people simply stop doing those because there is a beautiful m-commerce app instead. And using Google is a 4 step process while using the app is a 2 step process, then Google will loose out badly.<p>People will still go to Google for doing hard-core research, but those are informational queries. Potential advertisers don't like those queries because they don't have commercial intent. Not a good place to push products. People will click but wont be ready to buy.<p>Lastly, yes there is a search bar on all android devices. But I find my self using that only when I can find a sexy app to solve my problem more efficiently.<p>What do you guys think?

I'm now looking for a sustainable way to develop from a common code base and yet build so that I can submit to either/both.<p>As you may know, Amazon's store has some restrictions about available APIs, and hence I'd like to conditionally remove/modify features from that version.

1) Building/debugging using Eclipse.
2) Static code files, with environment/settings toggles to control what to build.

On the other hand, they may be brainwashed idiots.<p>It also creates a lot more divisive candidates. Obama is a far-left (by US standards, in Australia or Europe he'd be center-right).

Some of it has to do with having a reasonable level of competence; I'm not straining to understand everything.

I merely said there are legit reasons for using Javascript over C.<p>&#62; Node.js will never survive 2 million users if it faints at 1 thousand users.<p>&#62; For the same reason that makes Nginx faster than Apache: better coding.<p>Ok, now give me some details. These statements are meaningless on their own. ""will never survive"" contradicts real-world examples in which Node obviously <i>did</i> survive. Also, under what hardware? What networks? What operating systems? Under what test conditions?<p>Nginx is faster than Apache because of ""better coding""? That vague statement doesn't mean anything. Nginx is faster than Apache partially because of its architecture: evented vs multiprocessing/multithreading, speed at the cost of flexibility, memory allocation patterns, etc. Nginx isn't anywhere near the swiss army knife that Apache is, and as soon as it is it will become comparable in performance. I can pinpoint specific areas in Nginx and explain why they're faster than the equivalent in Apache. Can you do that with G-WAN vs the rest?<p>I'm looking an in-depth technical study of what makes G-WAN faster than the competition, not vague grand statements.<p>&#62; On the site that you claim that you have read.<p>They have the source code for the benchmarking app but not the hello world app. Direct link please.<p>&#62; You ""moderated"" this Hackers News entry to:

I do not, and do not want to, promote my products with FUD or inaccuracies.<p>&#62; Phusion Passenger is not censored on Wikipedia because, like Node.js, it is much slower than G-WAN.<p>What do censoring and Wikipedia have to do with this? And correct, it is slower. We focus on ease of use, reliability, stability and features, not raw performance. If highest req/sec at the cost of everything else is what you want, then you are looking at the wrong product.<p>I cannot help but feel that your statement that Phusion Passenger is ""much slower"" than G-WAN is an attack in an attempt to defend G-WAN. Again, it is not my intention to troll or spread FUD on G-WAN.<p>&#62; Maybe that's why you ask how G-WAN manages to be so much faster?<p>Yes, that is exactly why. As an application server author I am constantly seeking to improve my knowledge and skills in this area.<p>Performance is not always the end goal. It comes at a cost. Nginx is not faster than Apache because it's ""better coded"" but because of tradeoffs in architecture and features. Likewise, there are ways to make Phusion Passenger faster, but they come at the cost of reduced code maintainability, reduced feature set, etc.<p>And uhm, klue, whoever you are... please don't reply from a newly created account made for the mere sake of replying to me.

184735,,comment,lee,2008-05-08 17:58:47,"Here are some rules of thumb that may help guide your approach.<p>In my experience, you need to divide up your problem into two different issues to solve: design and branding. Design for functionality and smoothness of user experience. Brand so that your audience relates well to your product.<p>A lot's been written about good design. Yes, teens definitely respond to it. If a site's hard to use, they have the attention span of hummingbirds and if you cause an engagement failure because of poor usability, they'll be gone and won't return. Above all else, focus on making your site easy to use and the user experience seamless.<p>Branding depends on your audience's demographic. Most teens have developed a strong enough, though flexible, identity to be attracted to some things and repelled by others based on their perceived sense of who they are in their greater and lesser social ecosystems. You might be interested in reading everything danah boyd (intentionally lowercase) ever wrote, most especially ""Viewing American class divisions through Facebook and MySpace"" here: 
<a href=""http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html</a><p>In general, people, no matter what their age group, adapt to symbolic systems they're immersed in. Kids in gradeschool can glance at a page in a textbook and from the fonts, point size, layout, graphics, tell you precisely whether it's a third grade book or a fourth grade book, and therefore whether it's for them or not. (The same goes for someone looking at a full page ad in The New Yorker - font, point size, color choices, etc..) Higher income demographic kids are exposed to high end design by the time they're in their teens and have a more positive response to it than kids without the opportunity and exposure to design. In my own work with teens, non-college bound teens find Facebook's design BORRRRRING! [picture an entire class of kids singsonging that in unison] They tolerate a _lot_ of busy-ness and chaos on a page and will jump onto MySpace whenever your back is turned.",184345,,,,,

When your RSI begins, ergonomic keyboard may help you, may not help you, and often can make the problem even worse.<p>The way I see it, there are 2 main causes of RSI:<p>1) you work under stress, and you are hitting the keys much stronger and you are flexing your muscles much more than when you are more relaxed - this is a tremendous strain on your hands,<p>2) you are using a certain keyboard shortcut or successive combination thereof, or you are repeating certain specific movement which is causing you the RSI, while the RSI feels as if it's coming from the general usage of the keyboard, from generally using it too much.<p>3) (bonus point) It's something unrelated, like a missing vitamin or mineral in your body, or a heightened presence of a free radical or some other negative element. (I'm not a doctor so I won't elaborate here.)<p>I don't know how many ergonomic keyboards from Microsoft I destroyed while I was still on PC, but now I'm on a MBP 17"" and at one point I had to work with a bandage on my left hand, in pain. Turned out the cause were the shortcuts for application and window switching on OS X. This was CMD+Tab and CMD+` (on an US keyboard layout, so the both Tab and ` are kind of higher). So what I did, I searched for an app[1] to remap the keys to a much more sane[2] combinations, and that fixed my hand.<p>[1] KeyRemap4Macbook, my config here: <a href=""https://github.com/ypocat/misc/blob/master/keyremap4macbook/private.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ypocat/misc/blob/master/keyremap4macbook/...</a><p>[2] this just made me realize the default shortcut combinations for app and window switch are in fact insane.

How many users care about DRM and the integrity of their data, let alone its freedom and exportability?<p>Most users are not power users (else the term would be redundant). Most people who use computer that I know simply log on, surf the web, check email, etc. In fact, most users spend almost all of their time on a web browser, to the point that different systems seem pretty much the same.<p>Most users cannot quantify the difference between Mac OS X or Windows beyond the hardware differences, and even that&#x27;s just a momentary thought. They don&#x27;t care about data because it&#x27;s not relevant to their lifestyles.<p>Corollary to this point is the fact that many hackers attribute malice and spite to companies that don&#x27;t allow data freedom. But honestly, it&#x27;s not profitable for most companies to serve that small subset of users in the mass market because their voices aren&#x27;t loud enough.

6336250,,comment,tel,2013-09-05 20:16:27,"Seems like the major distinctions I see here compared to say Haskell (and Scala to the degree that Scala is equivalent to Hs) is that Schema are dynamic and first-class.<p>Dynamic means that their usefulness is tied somewhat to your ability to exercise code paths. Compare this to Hs&#x27;s static types where the type logic of your entire program (and all dependent libraries) is checked upfront before compilation. Schemata likely must be triggered by a validation function being called on live code. Endless further argumentation about this distinction goes here.<p>First-class comes from Schema&#x27;s dynamic nature as well but is worth further investigation. Schema look like they can be arbitrary functions of the arguments, much like inserting `assert`s at the beginning of a function and then flipping those on or off at a later time. They can also be composed&#x2F;decomposed&#x2F;analyzed as Clojure values. This vastly increases the flexibility and complexity of Schema for better and worse. You can express much more sophisticated invariants in your Schema than you can in Haskell types. It looks like it&#x27;s even possible for these invariants to be value-based—a concept which, in static typing land, is deep into research territory.<p>I&#x27;d say these contract-like invariant checkers are in a pretty different boat from static types. They check different classes of things at different times and make vastly different promises. What they both provide however, so long as your Schema don&#x27;t get too complex, is some wonderful &quot;living&quot; documentation.",6335266,,,,,

2336323,,comment,michaelochurch,2011-03-17 15:07:13,"I was perhaps being a bit brash in that post. I thought the intentionally satirical and bloviating nature of it would come through. Last night I wrote a 3,500-word essay on the massive upcoming conflict, in the United States, between the intelligent and the powerful. (I'm not going to spam HN with links to my blog, but it's my most recent post.) I guess I am still amped up on adrenaline from last night.<p>This would require another discussion, but college admissions aren't very meritocratic. There are a bunch of crypto-racist so-called ""character"" criteria (note: the ""right"" extracurriculars are only available at rich schools) that were shoved into the process in the 1920 to '60s and have been let to stay there. I'm going to mostly ignore that line of discussion because it's going to be 20 or 30 years before I have kids of that age, and until that point, I don't really care in the least about college admissions. College admissions are less corrupt than politics or the news media, but not by much; the corruption is <i>far</i> less damaging, though, because it's never been that hard for a smart person to get accepted into a good school. (<i>Prestigious</i> schools can be very hard to get into, but we have 200 or so <i>good</i> schools, including most of those state flagships the Republicans want to kill, in the U.S. We have excellent colleges and universities in this country and that's a huge asset.)<p>Do I think a forceful, tectonic reallocation of resources to smart people would give us a better world? Yes, absolutely. I won't go so far as ""resources can never be misallocated"" in a meritocracy, because that level of perfection is impossible, but I think we'd have a far better world with smarter, more creative, more visionary, and more compassionate people in charge, instead of the spineless, morally debased, and anti-intellectual corporate strongmen who currently hold most of the cards.",2336135,,,,,

AT&#38;T requires this with the iPhone.  Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. all require it for the Blackberry.  I haven't heard of a single device/provider that doesn't require an elevated service level to allow for enterprise mail access.<p>So there's a security by obscurity to start with: the average user doesn't know to ask for the Enterprise plan, let alone what Enterprise even means in context.  So the scenario here requires that a) the salesman talked them into it, b) they bought into that service for the extra $15 on top of the data plan, or c) they consulted with the company's IT department or policies and knew they had to get that service.  If they didn't, they simply cannot connect to the Exchange account.   There's very little ""oops, I didn't know what I was doing"" here.  I hope that most companies have a clear policy against checking your work e-mail from personal devices, and on your own time.  There are legal implications for overtime pay.  We may look the other way in startups, but this can't always be done.<p>Most law firms require this, unilaterally.  It's part of the deal-- we'll pay your enterprise data plan in exchange for knowing that we may wipe the device, control which apps you can install [this is another can of worms], so on and so forth, per the requirements of malpractice insurance and data security.<p>In a perfect world this wouldn't be required, but I think we all know this can't possibly be the case in many industries.",1684595,{1685798},,,,

Basically, you could say that it's like a web-based github for non-devs.<p>I could use a key-value store like couchdb or cassandra to store diffs between times when something is saved to show histories and do merges with one of the strategies git uses; and <i></i><i>maybe</i><i></i> in the future let users use a desktop app and thus clone/push/pull changes like a regular git hosting site.

836133,,comment,n8agrin,2009-09-22 03:46:36,"Always use ""var"" to define a variable, unless you know exactly what you are doing. e.g.:<p><pre><code>  var foo = 'bar';
</code></pre>
When you don't use ""var"" the Javascript interpreter breaks out of the current scope and continues to do so all the way until it hits the final global scope (generally the window object in browsers).  If it does not find the variable, it then defines it.  If it does find it, it will trample the found variable with the new value.  For example:<p><pre><code>  var foo = 'bar';

  function baz() {
    foo = 'baz';
  }

  baz();

  // now foo == 'baz';
  console.log(foo);
  &#62;&#62;'baz'
</code></pre>

We can up the density somewhat by bzip2-compressing and then uuencoding (or similar); maybe 10Mb/kg is achievable.<p>Normal A-format paperbacks use acidic wood pulp for paper, but acid-free paper doesn't add a whole lot to the cost. So we get roughly 10Gb/ton, and the whole kaboodle comes in at roughly 500 tons. As the density of wood pulp is close to that of water, this approximates to a 10 x 10 x 5 metre lump. Quite a large time capsule, but not unmanagable :)<p>However. If we posit the availability of decent optical scanners in 50 years' time, there's no reason not to go denser.<p>We can print the data as a bitmap at 300dpi and be reasonably sure of retrieving it using a 2400dpi scanner. Let's approximate 300dpi to 254dpi, and call it 10 bits/mm. Printed on reasonable quality acid-free paper, we can get 100mbits/square metre, and that square metre will weigh around 80 grams (it's 80gsm paper -- same as your laser printer runs on). Call it 1.1 mb/gram. At this density, we can print the whole 5Tb (or 40tbits) on just 40 tons of paper, without compression; with compression, call it 20 tons. That's a 2.71 metre cube; just under 9' on an edge.<p>This assumes a monochrome bitmap. If we go to colour and use archival-quality inks we can probably -- conservatively -- retrieve one bit each of red/blue/green per dot, and it's probably not unreasonable to expect to get a whole byte out in place of each bit in our mono bitmap.

It would be like me arguing; why don't governments print loads more money and we will all be rich as my reason they should not print anymore than we have today.<p>To stay on the money analogy; we want governments to print THE RIGHT amount of money. If they print too little the economy will suffer just as much as if they print too much. This is the same as a minimum wage. If it is too low it damages things like consumption and quality of life. Too much and it is damaging competitiveness etc.<p>I would suggest the best answer to this whole debate is in empirical data. Look at countries that have similar economies low AND high minimum wages and see what works best on the majority of case.<p>Also personal views weight this argument. My lean on this is argument is that a country should be run to give the largest amount of people the best quality of life possible. If you have no problem with a large poor/rich gap you could easily argue to keep minimum wage down.<p>Also Germany doesn't have a minimum wage but has legally enforced collective bargaining. Companies don't just pay what they think people are worth. Your example is not really givings the full story by pointing out there is no statutory minimum wage. Their government has employed a different system to ensure wage levels meet workers needs and is nothing like giving companies carte blanche to pay poverty wages.,5334136,,,,,

5785117,,comment,logicallee,2013-05-29 08:30:59,"So, I'm glad you got into the subject of car washes and oil changes.  We're trying to regulate car washes so that we can control that market - otherwise, let's say we succeed in a federated model where to be a car wash practitioner you must go through 14 years of very competitive school costing about $1M all told, with a car wash residency on top.  This might bring car wash technique into the 21st century, it would result in amazing advances in research, everything from new detergents to car wash garage equipment that makes what we see now seem absolutely third-world.  Yes, it would cost $2000-$8000 for a basic wash, but that's actually a low price to pay for clean cities and sanitation, and also it's the list price.  Yes, a lot of people would stop washing their cars, that is a personal choice.  For the oil changes, we're in a better position - you MUST change your oil from time to time, otherwise you will suffer catastrophic engine damage.  People have very little choice.  So here, we can get up into the $8000's or so, based on what happens if you don't change your oil.  Again, with amazing research and so forth.  How many prestigious oil change journals do you think there are today?  It is just third world at the moment, this is why we need the medical model here.<p>Then there's the usual benefits, one of the main points of leverage employers would have over any of their employees who drive or are even thinking of driving, is that in fact en masse the employer could ensure these workers for oil changes for a tiny fraction of that list price.  Maybe as low as only $500-$800 per month.<p>This keeps people from being ""self-starters"" who fail to produce value for large companies, instead they would have to negotiate with our federated program on a per-individual basis.<p>But there is a big problem with both of the above utopias: unlicensed practitioners.  Sure, if you look at the third world where people are free to try to put whatever they want into their cars, anything from sand to little pieces of plastic toys they melt down - at great risk to all drivers on the road should the cars explode, not to mention to themselves - the oil change prices are very low.  Barely the cost of oil that has next to no research into it, plus labor that is about the skill-level of a barber in the middle ages.  They do not have 14 or even 12 years of schooling, nor debts even reaching $200K let alone an amount that would motivate them to keep charging the federated prices.<p>So the first step toward utopia is really, we have to clamp down on unlicensed car washes and oil changes.  We need a board certification that includes deep understanding of all parts that make up a car, from basic metallurgy to internal combustion and battery technology chemistry.  Yes, some people will wash out of metallurgy classes, or projectile calculus, but are these really the people you want taking care of your only means of transportation?<p>Transportation is literally one of the few things that separates us from people in the middle ages, allows us to live and work more than a few meters apart, and enables us to live meaningful lives.  Without transportation, we have nothing.<p>So it makes sense to clamp down on the unregulated practices related to serious procedures such as oil changes as well as elective, cosmetic procedures like a car wash.  Where the prices are such that certain individuals might not be able to bear the full burden, that's EXACTLY what insurance is for!",5784949,,,,,

  &#62; wants one, but no one wants to pay for it"" is absurd. We see many
  &#62; examples of charitable contributions made by the rich and the middle
  &#62; class which are used to purchase public goods such as museums, nature
  &#62; preserves and the like.

We also see many cases of governments which have much higher tax rates than ours and provide fantastic public services.<p><pre><code>  &#62; When push comes to shove, what Buffet really wants -- and what you are
  &#62; advocating when you say that no matter how much money he donates, it
  &#62; ""will not be enough to solve our budget issues"" -- is an increase in the
  &#62; size of government fueled by higher taxes, rather than a diminution of
  &#62; its scope by reducing the funds made available to it.
</code></pre>
Being blunt: How do you know what Buffett really wants, or what orijing is really advocating? You've just described how you perceive Buffett's motives and orijing's assertions.<p>And why present this as a ""lower taxes vs. smaller government"" issue? That seems <i>incredibly</i> disingenuous. What is truly being advocated by many is a combination of <i>both</i>. What's the best way to solve a debt issue? Increase income while also decreasing spending. Why cripple the process by ignoring half the solution?<p><pre><code>  &#62; A bigger government benefits crony capitalists like Buffet, because they
  &#62; have sufficient power and influence to ensure that the goodies that can
  &#62; be redistributed by the Leviathan are steered their way. I wish Buffet
  &#62; would be honest enough to say that, rather than bloviating about how
  &#62; terrible it is that he doesn't pay enough taxes when he is unwilling to
  &#62; take the obvious direct action necessary to rectify that unfortunate
  &#62; situation.
</code></pre>
What evidence do you have of Buffett benefiting from government programs, or having taken advantage of cronyism? Honest question – he very well may have significantly increased his wealth from connections with other ""crony capitalists"". I have no evidence either way.<p>That said, do we need to look at past examples of when aggressive government spending has helped individuals or small companies? Once again, this doesn't need to be a black and white world – as the spender of last resort, the government can provide liquidity and resources to individuals, small companies, and large companies when no one else is willing to take the risk. Yes, some people may profit immensely as a result. Does that mean those programs were wrong? And a bigger government doesn't have to only benefit ""crony capitalists""...<p>I don't understand why a holistic view is so rarely considered in these discussions. Rather than making this an ""right vs. wrong"", ""rich vs. poor"", ""liberal vs. conservative"", ""communist vs. capitalist"" argument, let's make it a discussion to find the best solution to our problems.

I think, ""what is the worst they can do with this law?""  That's what has to be acceptable to me.  Because there are a lot of ""theys,"" and somewhere somebody is going to get the idea that the law can be applied in a new way because of the way it is written.  I vaguely recall a Supreme Court decision in the '90s (or was it the '80s?) that pissed a lot of people off.  They interpreted the law as it was written, not as most people thought it was intended.  Their answer was (Scalia or somebody) ""we need to write a new law.""  I wish I could recall more.<p>The good lawyers I know are quite articulate and are capable of making themselves quite clear.  As you indicate, the law on its best day is fraught with multiple interpretations simply because as a whole it's a complex system of many interacting parts.  But each part we add should be as clear as possible.  I see passing a law with terms ill-defined as, frankly, malpractice.<p>And Turar rephrased it as he interpreted it, yes.  My point is the original should have been phrased like that if that is what they meant.  It's not beyond the authors' capabilities.  In short, I expect them to do the best they can.

1335783,,comment,bediger,2010-05-10 21:12:44,"Probably just a few things contribute to most of the ""productivity"" you can get from vim:<p>1. Commands to move around the screen and file under edit: with at most 2 keystrokes you can (a) move to next word (b) move to previous word (c) move to start of line (d) move to end of line (e) move to start of file (f) move to end of file (g) move 1 character in any direction (h) move to the end of next word (i) move to end of previous word (j) move to the next word like the one under the cursor (k) move to the previous word like the one under the cursor.  Other commands exist to make moving around really efficient: you rarely take your hands off the keyboard to do mousing.<p>2. Use of regular expressions for searching for text, and as a way of distinguishing edits.  You can do things like change all tabs to 4 spaces with a single command, or change the tabs at the beginning of the line to 4 spaces. This is an astoundingly powerful idea, rarely exploited however.<p>3. Vim, improving on vi, has the ""visual"" modes, where you can use movement keys (see item 1) to choose a hunk of a file, then apply edits or change commands to that block.<p>4. Vim isn't really modal like all the propaganda has you believe.  Sure, 'i' or 'a' or 'I' or 'O' will put you in what you can naively interpret as ""literal typing mode"". But you should really think of those as commands, followed by text, as you can do 5Ax&#60;esc&#62; and append 5 'x' characters to the end of the line.  If you think about what most people call ""modes"" correctly, you can pull off a lot of interesting and fast edits.<p>5.

But I'll share an experience of mine.<p>I lived in the 79th precinct, adjacent to the 81st. It's less dangerous, but not much -- still Bed Stuy and very block by block. I was there for about 6 months in late 2007.<p>The area is tense at times -- much of New York's prosperity over the last two decades hasn't trickled down to the people living there aside from landlords selling their buildings to gentrifies or speculators. There was an incident around this time where an unstable young man was shot because he had a comb the police mistook for a weapon in the dark. I wouldn't have been surprised if it had escalated into riots. Gentrification is welcome by some, protested by some, and many are indifferent to it, I think. There are very few nice places to eat or socialize or even get groceries, but there are a ton of bodegas and fried chicken/pizza places and dollar stores. It can be a very rough place, which is too bad as I got to know some very nice people on my block.<p>Certainly there are institutional problems in the NYPD, but also I have the suspicion that many rookie cops eventually get rotated into areas like this -- Bushwick, Bed Stuy, East New York and this contributes to much of the stuff you will learn about in these tapes. The penis jokes, the confusion on what to report and not gracefully handling tension within the communities -- I wonder if it is inexperience.<p>Comparisons to The Wire are natural, but in the time I lived in Bed Stuy, the only similarity I really observed was that the NYPD guys never seemed to interact with the people of the neighborhood as if they too were part of that community. Never said hi while walking their beats, never stopped to talk to the kids or the corner boys, they mostly walked in twos or threes, chatting with each other. I think for the people that live there and the cops that work there, there is us and them and not much in between.",1334903,{1336173},,,,

Just replacing document.getElementsByTagName by document.querySelectorAll (the native, browser-implemented version of what jQuery does) will generate a 150-200x perf hit depending on the browser.<p>The reason for that is twofold: first, getElementsByTagName doesn't have to parse the selector, figure out what is asked for, and potentially fall back on explicit JS implementation (jQuery supports non-native selectors. In fact, I believe you can implement your own selectors). But the parsing overhead should be minor in this precise case.<p>Second, the real reason for the difference, getElementsByTagName cheats something fierce: it doesn't return an Array like everybody else, it returns a NodeList. And the nodelist is lazy, it won't do anything before it needs to. Essentially, just calling document.getElementsByTagName is the same as calling an empty function. If you serialize the nodelist to an array (using Array.prototype.slice.call), bam 150~200x perf hit.<p>See <a href=""http://jsperf.com/vanillajs-by-tag/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/vanillajs-by-tag/2</a> for these two alterations added to the original ""vanilla JS"" perf cases.<p>There is a significant overhead to jQuery, but it's ~3x compared to the equivalent DOM behavior, not 400x.",4435886,,,,,

Add in for yourself and other hangers-on additional equity based on time worked from this point forward, with industry-standard vesting.<p>You can also fold in an acquisition:  Start new company, all the old company's assets are valued at X and you proportionally issue Y nonvoting shares in the new company to all the old shareholders (where Y is a small percentage of the total).  Cofounder must either sign off or be outvoted at old company, or else you're stuck.<p>Crackpots always think that their work begins and ends before a product gets traction (even many prodigious successful businesspeople lean this way until they learn by succeeding) when the truth of the matter is that the work is much more back-loaded than it seems.<p>If you hired a general contractor to build a house, and he left it 50% done, lots of times you'd have to pay more to get it completed than if you'd never hired him at all.

1234688,,comment,tokenadult,2010-04-01 15:44:15,"A friend from the school (a parent) kindly asked me by personal email in what capacity I wrote the parent comment here. I should make clear that I was (and am) writing in my individual capacity as one parent among a few hundred in a start-up school community. My opinions are my own, and are surely not shared by all other parents of students at the school. I see from the several typos in the parent post that I was in vent mode, typing rapidly to express disagreement with the article that opened the thread.<p>That said, I have been puzzled by the lack of pan-school online community for the parents and for the students at the EPGY Online High School, because there are numerous examples of thriving communities of that kind elsewhere in cyberspace. Evidently (according to personal accounts I have heard from other students and news reports I have read) it is quite routine at most online high schools to subscribe all students to a pan-school online community as soon as they enroll. The asynchronous online community allows students with varied schedules to make friends and share interests--just as Hacker News does. An asynchronous online community is an especially important social help for a school in which school classes are conducted by synchronous video links just a few hours per week, and all the more so if the school has students from all over the world living in every which time zone.<p>I am a big proponent of online interaction even for communities who regularly interact face-to-face. For example, I am a Yahoo Groups listowner for groups that link my local homeschooling support group since 2003 (more than 100 members) and our statewide gifted education parent advocacy group since 2005 (about 500 members). The online groups massively increase the helpfulness of the face-to-face interaction the families in each organization have, and of course tend to promote more face-to-face meet-ups as opportunities arise. They facilitate sharing information and encouragement and guarantee that official communications from each group will be understood and mutually discussed right away.<p>Similarly, my son is in dual-enrollment classes at our state flagship university, and thus inherently meets some classmates face-to-face each day (especially in his foreign language classes). Yet the overall dual-enrollment program makes mandatory for students and optional (highly encouraged) for parents to sign up for an email list through which to receive official program announcements. Most of my son's individual classes also make very effective use of email and announcements posted on websites (our state flagship university has numerous ongoing human-computer interaction studies) and some of his hardest classes make formal use of web forums for student discussion of the content of the class. This deepens both the intellectual life and community spirit of those classes. I need not mention here that HN is fun even for hackers who know one another in person in offline life. I expected such a vital online community when we signed up for the founding class of the online high school we know from its inception, but that community has yet to be formed.<p>I suppose most parents make most such comparisons based on locally available resources. Certainly other parents think that EPGY Online High School is their best current bundle of trade-offs for their children's education. I think my town has both better homeschooling support groups and better public and private high schools than most places in the United States--better by test, as can be confirmed in quite a few cases. College admission for homeschoolers is a solved problem,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><p>as I have known since my oldest son was an infant, so I was never the least bit worried about college admission prospects for a ""purist"" homeschooled child. We sought out the new online high school from Stanford because of previous good experiences using à la carte distance learning courses<p><a href=""http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/</a><p>to supplement his homeschooling, and because he and I both have a spirit of risk-taking and a willingness to try something new with little track record. But with the benefit of hindsight, for us in our local environment, it would have better to have him enrolled at Brand X local high school through our state's open enrollment statute, and to continue to do just one or two distance learning classes on the side, before going full-time for university dual-enrollment for eleventh and twelfth grade. Reasonable minds can differ, because different families live in different communities, but my disagreement with the author of the interesting submitted article is that I don't think all online high schools have yet figured out how to be significantly better (in social aspects as well as intellectual aspects) than locally available public or private schools in most parts of the United States. I like to support the school that my family participates in by urging it to be the best that it can be.",1230972,,,,,

I have lost some time to some of these bugs.  However if you compare the amount of time lost to Firebug bugs and vs IE6 support, it's still heavily skewed to IE6.  The fact is that not everyone can know every bug in IE6, and though it's not too hard to avoid the big well-known issues, you may end up cutting design and interactive features or write a lot of ugly workarounds to deliver comparatively simple features.  Additionally there are many subtle issues which become exponentially difficult to debug and isolate because the environment is so utterly opaque (admittedly I haven't tried Microsoft's commercial tools which I've heard actually have some utility, but I'll be damned before I pay a Microsoft tax just to debug for their hopeless broken software).<p>Firebug bugs are easier to deal with because there is more information and controls with which to isolate bugs.

If you're in a startup versus a big corporation, you're already enabled to work outside the box versus typically being stifled. My issue is that I've met entire teams who had, upon further conversation, skewed or incorrect impressions on how an industry worked. I think this is dangerous and will cause extra ""bobbing and weaving"" in their strategy, which costs them in time and money: money that an early stage startup doesn't have much of.<p>So I look at this as a probability game: you don't want to lower the odds of success by not really knowing how an industry works but raise it.  Some possible solutions are having advisors and being open to research, but I've also seen teams who didn't have resident founders not really act on advice or research.  It's much better to have a founder who has direct experience with that industry to be a daily, trusted member of the team pushing in the right direction constantly BUT you have to not be discouraged by the way an industry currently operates; you must have belief, focus, and drive to push disruption to change the rules of the industry you're attacking. What often happens with resident industry experts is that the team gets discouraged by all the barriers - to me this is the killer of an idea, not the knowledge.<p>Can you be a success without having a founder from the industry? Sure - look at Paypal who defied normal conventions of banking, amongst other really big examples of disruption. Let's just say there are many factors that drive success and that being disruptive is only one. Again, it's a probability game and you want to load the odds in your favor for success, not lower them...",529934,,,,,

(Maybe the Internet will change that. The jury is still out on whether it can, as well as on whether the negative consequences of that are too great and we'll have to take steps to ensure that the Internet <i>can't</i> destroy your reputation worldwide. Reputation isn't all smiles and balloons. You can destroy innocent lives with reputation. Happens all the time.)<p>Reputation just doesn't <i>work</i> in all sorts of situations. Madoff is a prime example, but anyone who uses Twitter, reads <i>The Four Hour Workweek</i> or spends twenty minutes watching TV commercials can find thousands of additional examples. Reputation is easily faked. It is easily bought. It is too readily extrapolated from one narrow field of endeavor to another. It is biased toward members of your family, and toward people who resemble members of your family. It relies on past results to predict future results, and thereby mispredicts events that occur on a longer time scale than the acquisition of a reputation. It works by implicitly assuming its own effectiveness and breaks down in edge cases. (""Why would Mr. Jones feed me Kool-Aid laced with poison? Just think what that would do to his reputation!"")<p>Most importantly, reputation is just a <i>predictive</i> tool. When it fails, it leaves you with no recourse: That is not its job. I can use my accountant's reputation to predict whether he will steal my money. But if he does steal my money, reputation is now useless as a tool for getting my money back. That's what a contract is for. The primary purpose of a contract isn't promoting trust; it promotes trust because its primary purpose is to <i>give me recourse</i> after trust breaks down. I can try to take my money <i>back</i> from my account -- and if that doesn't work I can attempt to take it out of his insurance company, his auditors, or even people he has previously paid (look up <i>clawback</i> in the dictionary -- my accountant just explained it to me).",529991,{530080},,,,

530038,,comment,phugoid,2009-03-24 13:00:06,"If I understand his argument correctly, esr is claiming that companies can't profit from grabbing a handful of open source software and building their own product around it.  The open source development model is so superior that said company will be left in the dust with their handful of code, while the open project will maintain dominance.<p>So why scare anyone away with restrictive licenses when open source will naturally prevail anyway.<p>But what about the advantage Microsoft gained from basically grabbing a BSD-licensed TCP stack for WinNT?  Apparently they recoded most of that stuff since then, but it was probably a great help at the time.  All you need to defeat esr's argument is one or two cases where it was proven wrong.<p>In my opinion, the GPL is not just a legal document but a cultural artifact.  When you see a GPL notice, you can feel warm fuzzy feelings of sharing certain beliefs with the authors about freedom and sharing.  You can feel the peace that comes with source code.<p>To paraphrase you, why should I invest my own free time in a project that could be subverted from bringing freedom to its users?<p>Market- and mind-share are not everyone's measure of success.

If you want to attribute all of a person's success to the school they pass through, be my guest. I can similarly say the IRS is the cause of the US being a ""20'th century powerhouse"" - after all, 100% of US businesses are taxed by the IRS.<p>But the fact is, the US is fairly unique in terms of innovation and growth. The education system is, by most measures I've seen, fairly mediocre [1]. And additionally, a fairly large amount of our workforce, particularly at the higher ends, didn't even use the public education system. It seems like an extraordinary claim to attribute the success of the US to our public schools. Yeah, we need public schools/indoor plumbing/electricity, but it would be similarly silly to claim we are a powerhouse as a result of those services.<p>[1] As far as I'm aware, this was always the case.

There's a book -- 4-hour-work-week -- that a lot of folks are trying to make work. In technology teams especially. I tell my teams that I don't care how much you work or don't: what matters is productivity and predictability.<p>Sure, lots of others don't feel that way, but it's up to each situation. If there were some good lessons to be learned from some example? Bring them on! I'm all for it.<p>Second, complex systems of hundreds of millions of people do very poorly as an engineering experiment. Or -- you can't decide how you want things to turn out and then pull some magic lever and have it turn out that way. It's never that simple. So discussions about huge generalizations are premised on a really bad flaw: that somehow we can massively change everything at one time.<p>[edit]As an example, you couldn't decide in 1970 that you wanted every person to have a notebook computer by 2020. You could decide to train more people in hard sciences. You could decide to make incentives for investing. But you can't take one complex system as an example and then tell another one to conform to it. That's just not the way complex systems work. And that's not meant as a political comment. That's just a rule of complex systems.[/edit]<p>It's much better to take all the new information you can find and incorporate it from the ground-up. Want a society with 20-hour work weeks? Cool. Go build one. Nobody is stopping you, and if it's wildly successful then others will very quickly copy it. This is a very easy thing. Actually from this angle I don't even see the point of the article.<p>The only other angle is that someone or somebody -- one presumes government -- should tell us how to do our work. From my own experience, technology is one of the few areas where we create our own reality. And time and time again, we make it sucky on ourselves. But it's our reality.

However, places like the Netherlands and Scandinavia, even if they punch above their weight in many fields, are not too big in the grand scheme of things. Again, I don't know that the situation is like in the hard sciences or in CS, but certainly in my field the fact that Europe has well-funded PhD programs and jobs does not help the pretty dire (as far as I can see) situation in the US.

CakePHP, or Symfony, or Rails, or Django is to web applications what paint + scaffolding + tarpaulins + masking tape + ladders is to painting.<p>Yes, you can build a ladder in the programming language you like, or you can just import one (or, in many cases, not have to) with a framework.  They both still use paint, and I completely disagree with the assertion that a framework tells you where or what kind of paint to put -- it just puts you closer to the walls, and makes the application of said paint a little easier.<p>For the record, I personally consider an application framework more like a Wagner spray painter, or something more like that, but I think that's more dependent on the framework itself.  Yes, there are constraints with frameworks, but there are significant advantages to speed of development.<p>As for the whole PHP vs Python, I'm completely ignoring, since you seem to be conflating PHP vs 'application frameworks in other languages' instead of PHP vs 'another language', which is unfair at best, and ill-informed at worst.

Dropbox currently doesn’t offer anything that iCloud offers. iCloud and Dropbox are different products with very little overlap.<p>There certainly is a Dropbox shaped hole in iCloud. (I will not dare and claim that there is an iCloud shaped hole in Dropbox. iCloud didn’t even have a chance to be successful yet and Dropbox is very successful without anything iCloud offers.)<p>Now, I have been thinking that Apple’s long term plan is to get rid of the file system (as something the user has to deal with). iCloud and even more so iOS are steps in that direction. Even Apple, however, has to acknowledge that there will at least be a transitional period between now and that future. That’s where the Dropbox shaped hole comes in. Dropbox is (currently) all about the filesystem: There is this folder and you can stick anything at all in it to get it synced across your devices and to be able to access it from the web.<p>Dropbox has that implemented perfectly. I don’t know whether Apple could copy that. I personally never used it but people have been telling me that iDisk (which was conceptually pretty similar to Dropbox) sucked.<p>Still, it would be weird for Apple to go off in a direction like that. Not sure whether they are willing to, well, more or less backtrack with iCloud (back to the filesystem).",2985737,,,,,

I wanted to make web apps, and wanted it hard. So the few things i learnt were:
you need to know basic HTML, CSS.
Server Side Scripting: PHP/Python/Ruby 
Client Side Scripting: Javascript(jQuery is the new JavaScript)
You should also know the terms like DNS, CNAME etc. so that you can put your content on a web server to start of with a shared hosting from any provider would be good.<p>But the above will only let you make very basic apps. 
If you want to make slightly more complex things, there are Content Management Solutions like Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal. (these are amongst the most popular ones, they have readymade plugins so if your only motive is to get a site up and running, they will serve the purpose.)<p>If you want more customization you might have to learn MVC frameworks. Here(<a href=""http://blog.fruiapps.com/2012/04/Understanding-MVC-Architecture-with-a-simple-example"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fruiapps.com/2012/04/Understanding-MVC-Architect...</a>) i have written a basic tutorial on MVC. The popular frameworks are 
Ruby on Rails
Django (Python)
CodeIgnitor(PHP)
BackBone (JS)
My rule of thumb for deciding is:
Get a hang of a server side scripting language(PHP/Python/Ruby), choose the framework  in that particular language.<p>Another most important rule that you should keep in mind is:
All that you want to do has been done, you need to assemble it your way!!
Learn to copy, modify and paste to suit your needs. 
Don't be afraid of any implementation it will be out somewhere there.

Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.&quot;<p>Additional information: <a href=""http://rufuspollock.org/2009/09/22/talk-at-atrip-conference-how-long-should-copyright-last/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rufuspollock.org&#x2F;2009&#x2F;09&#x2F;22&#x2F;talk-at-atrip-conference-...</a>",6134756,{6135225},,,,

What would you do with this:<p><pre><code>    char *((*func)(char *));

That isn't a char pointer at all. It's a pointer to a <i></i>function<i></i> that takes a char pointer as an argument and returns (i.e., <i></i>evaluates to<i></i>) a char pointer. It looks incredibly dense (to me, at least), <i></i>unless<i></i> I think of it in the way I talked about above (in which case it all makes sense and is kind of cool).<p>With the convention used in the article, the declaration would be something like this:<p><pre><code>    char* ((* func)(char*));

Which doesn't make clear why the outside parentheses are needed, or why there is a dereference (or multiplication?) operator in front of the variable name.<p>The idea of a variable declaration being an expression that evaluates to a basic type is actually the reason why the same symbol * is used in the declaration and in the dereferencing of pointers: <i></i>they mean the same thing<i></i>.<p>Basically, what I am trying to say is that the typographical practice used in the article is at odds with the actual meaning of the statement (and the explanation he gives shows he clearly does misunderstand the statement), which can only lead to confusion in the long run, especially when you encounter code written by other people.

Among the first things they did on obtaining legislative control in late 1994 was start work on rewriting  immigration law - resulting legislation so draconian that experienced criminal lawyers are often floored by its provisions when they have occasion to study it.<p>For example, an alien with a criminal record who is unable to prove their right to be present in the US on the spot can be detained incommunicado for <i>six months</i> before being entitled to any kind of hearing. This is a step forward; until a few months ago, the government was able to detain said alien <i>indefinitely</i>: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=972155883341975337&#38;hl=en&#38;as_sdt=2&#38;as_vis=1&#38;oi=scholarr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9721558833419753...</a><p>Bear in mind that the President is sworn to uphold the laws as they are, even when he disagrees with them; his powers are far more circumscribed by Congress than most people appreciate, viz. Obama's oft-repeated desire to close Guantanamo, which has gone nowhere because Congress won't authorize funds for setting up detention facilities on the mainland. It's not so much the case that Obama wants to know who you were calling last Tuesday as that he's supposed to maximize the government's <i>legislated</i> powers to defend the US from attack. If he ordered the NSA to suspend this sort of intelligence-gathering and subsequently a terrorist attack took place that could supposedly have been prevented, he'd be impeached. The whole Benghazi thing is arguably an effort to build momentum for impeachment, IMHO - if the GOP gained supermajority control of the Senate the current House would draft articles of impeachment in a heartbeat.",5834730,,,,,

Many newspapers have had to cut back on resources because of declining readership and its hard to expect decent investigative news from any of the network news stations because they are just pandering to their own audiences for ratings and whatnot. It also doesn't help the president Obama and his administration have been incredibly hard on journalists and those who leak information as we have learned over the last month. Even though it was the Guardian that was the paper that reported it, Glenn Greenwald, an American, is the author of the original article.

6186056,,comment,ruswick,2013-08-09 16:02:28,"This argument is really vacuous and makes an inappropriate analogy.<p>First, we need to distinguish between attaching ads to <i>the mail experience</i> versus injecting them into the <i>actual content</i>. In the original post, this service would actually open these letters and insert ads into them. This is not even remotely comparable to what most email providers do. They insert ads around the service, but never actually alter the content of the email. A better analogy would be receiving a discount on branded stamps or allowing advertisements to be displayed on your mailbox.<p>Second, the use of the term &quot;read&quot; when discussing advertising is asinine, disingenuous and probably detrimental to the conversation (inasmuch as it can provoke unnecessary fear in non-technical users). &quot;Read&quot; implies active evaluation and comprehension, conceivably by a person. The GMail algorithm does not &quot;read&quot; email in the classical sense. It systematically evaluates the content in a way isn&#x27;t even remotely comparable to &quot;reading.&quot; (This doesn&#x27;t mean that this sort of advertising isn&#x27;t bad, but portraying it in the way he did is just unnecessary fear mongering.)<p>Third, the OP seems to decry &quot;keeping a copy&quot; as some sort of violation. GMail is a webmail service. What the fuck are they supposed to do if not store your mail?<p>Fourth, this service actually seems like a good idea, and is probably something I would use for various types of mail. The price of mail  been steadily increasing, and I would be fine with these practices if I knew they were saving me money. I&#x27;m willing to tolerate advertising so long as I know that the service is improving my life. Like I do with 95% of the things I use.<p>In conclusion, this is a very dubious analogy that doesn&#x27;t really contribute to the pragmatic discussion of cost versus privacy.",6184558,"{6186165,6186481}",,,,

Even software that was updated for OSX does not work, because the installer is for classic and then the updater updates the program to carbon (or whatever) version. With every switch in OSX focus there is software that is getting lost (with switch to intel, we lost some.

5186043,,comment,abraxasz,2013-02-08 02:58:11,"I've had to learn R during my master (in statistics), and found the process very unpleasant.<p>There are different ways in which a language can be difficult to learn. Haskell has a steep learning curve because it has a lot of unusual concepts (for those who come from an imperative background) and requires a shift in the way we think about code. J is also difficult to learn because the syntax is crazy, and again, the language is very different from what we're used to.<p>I found R difficult to learn because it is seems inconsistent to me. Now one reason might be that I picked up bits of R here and there without taking the time to learn the syntax from a book (unlike what I did for other languages), but it took me quite some time to be able to make sense of the different structures (vector, list, matrix, dataframe), their differences, and in particular how functions operate differently on these structures. I also have a deep hatred for the system of attributes (why would anyone want to give attributes to a vector...), and find the indexing system (especially for lists) to be nonsensical. In fact, I think that lists themselves are terrible to work with.<p>The general impression that I've had learning R is the language is not coherent and systematic in its design in the way other languages are (I know python, c, common lisp, ...), and I find myself spending a lot of time in the interpreter simply trying out things because I'm not sure that it will return what I want, in the format that I want (which never happens to me in any other language).<p>Now don't get me wrong, I use R daily and it's a useful tool. It has lots of great libraries, including the fantastic ggplot2, and the remarkable Rcpp (best C++ interface I've ever seen.. ok I haven't seen any other, but this one is really great). But learning it was no fun, and if the statistics community decided to move to a cleaner language, I'd definitely be running ahead..",5185884,"{5186057,5186574,5186853}",,,,

Figure out which of your courses transfer.  Figure out how to work the system so you can graduate in two years.  You'll be 23 or 24 and have a degree from a top 10 computer science department.  Sounds like a pretty damn good life to me.<p>Now let's talk some more specifics.  You'll probably need another year to establish residency in Georgia.  In that time, you need to make yourself a more attractive candidate so you can get in.  If you can, get yourself down to Georgia Tech and get a job around there. A system admin job in the school's IT department would be ideal.  Sit in on classes, conference with admissions officers, and call in any favors you have to get a good recommendation from someone in high school.  Study for the ACT (or SAT if GT doesn't take the ACT).  Honestly with half a year of preparation you can raise your score a ton.  A strong standardized test would improve your application a lot.  Take classes at a community college for a semester near GT.  Get at least two kick ass recommendations from professors there and make sure you get a 3.5 GPA or higher.  Note, getting good recommendations is an easy process.  Just let your enthusiasm for computer science show, go in to the professors office hours to ask questions, and work on an independent project with them.  Honestly, since GT is a public school, there are probably incentives in place to take a certain number of community college students per year and that can help you.<p>Some people here might advise you to teach yourself what you need and try to make it on your own.  Let's be realistic.  You don't even know if you are capable of working hard yet on highly technical projects.  School will teach you that, and give you the ability to get a job if starting a company doesn't work out.<p>To give you a bottom line, you need an associates degree, at least a 3.5 GPA (&#62; 3.7 is much better) in your community college classes, and at least two excellent recommendations from professors there.  You also need a kick ass essay, which you should spend a lot of time writing and sharing with people.  Any personal connection you can establish with people at the school before you apply is just an added bonus.   You can make it happen, and three years from now the world will look completely different.",635192,,,,,

And the api design is highly constraint by the hardware. You also need to understand that opengl 1.3 is FCKING 11 YEARS OLD !<p>Back in the day you had immediate mode. You first call glBegin, then make one call to glVertex for each vertex and finally call glEnd. So if you want to render one frame of a cube, that's 1+6*4+1=26 calls, and for each call your cpu send data to the graphic card.
There are two huge problems with that : you need to the transfer the same vertex data to the graphic card for each frame and your cpu processing power limit your graphic card processing power (because cpu calls take way more time than your graphic card takes to render a vertex).<p>Why was it designed like that in the first place if it's inefficient ? Easy : there were no graphic card. All the 3D rendering was done by the cpu.<p>So with the development of more powerful graphic card, they updated the specification. With the new api you allocate memory buffers of vertex directly on your graphic card memory and you just need to call one function to render the whole buffer. So you don't need to transfer all the vertex data at each frame, and you don't need to do gazillion of function calls to render a cube.
THIS WAS IN 2004 !<p>So when the khronos consortium (just a reminder, the ""idiots"" are : Apple, AMD/ATI, Nvidia, Intel, Google, Id Software, ...) decided in 2007 to make a mobile version (ES stand for embedded system) of opengl, did they choose to base their api on something conceived in 1992 and dropped in 2004 ?
OF COURSE NOT !<p>But why not keep it compatible ? Well it's a waste of time. Developers shouldn't use deprecated functionality since 2004 in 2012, especially when it's highly inefficient.<p>This guy need to grow up, understand that opengl ES main objective is not screensavers, understand that he sometimes need to update a little bit his programming knowledge and acknowledge that he's not an expert in the very complex field of gpu.<p>tldr; he's the idiot",4134426,"{4136222,4136959}",,,,

But let's see how it kind of philosophically does make a tiny bit of sense. It does violate my privacy (even more) if someone tells me they've been spying on me.<p>To see this, consider: after someone spies on you, what's the least damage they can do to your privacy?  Obviously the most is to publish everything they have on you for everyone.  But what's the least?<p>The least damage is to completely forget it, never mention it, never think about it, and not even acknowledge or record it - let the world be exactly the same as if they had not spied on me.<p>I'm not saying this is better than ACTUALLY not ever spying on me, but it's the best thing for my privacy once they have.<p>Say you're a security person and do bag searches, a celebrity comes through and you actually see something very embarrassing in their bag, on some subject there's been public speculation on.  (Their sexuality, whether they have some disease and you see meds for it, whatever).    What's the best way to protect their privacy after you clear them (nothing dangerous in the bag)?<p>Obviously, by not even mentioning/acknowledging that you searched them, just by moving on.<p>If all my email (along with everyone else's) is being scanned to see if I'm concocting a terrorist plot, then the best you can do <i>after</i> this fact is not even ackowledge this and in every way act and produce a world as though it never happened.<p>Note that this does not make the original invasion of privacy any better.  It doesn't condone it.  It may also make it harder to instate more appropriate privacy policies in the future.  But the premise ""If I answered you 'every single person on US territory who has sent an email or made or received a telephone call in the past 36 months' then it would violate your privacy"" is not completely devoid of any merit.  Should every single person's privacy have been violated?  No.  We have constitutional protections against that sort of thing.<p>If it has, would it violate their privacy further to go boasting about this fact?  What if it means that anyone suing you for anything can use this knowledge to do discovery and request your communications from the government?  In this and a myriad other scenarios, telling the extent to which you invaded people's privacy can be worse for their privacy than refusing to do so.<p>Not saying I'm convinced.

All alone you cannot build for all the platform. So the first idea which came to me that why not build only web-apps which are responsive and hence can run smoothly on all platforms. But the problem was having a great experience on a web app is difficult. But if you think about it, its not true for all cases, you can have great experience and utility if the app itself is extremely simple and minimal.<p>And this is true in many many apps. In fact its true for Hacker News itself. So I thought of building a store for apps which are extremely minimal yet useful. The four apps (Running, Pins, Movies and Notes) are all my creation. Some of them you might find useful on a daily basis and some are useful only on specific occasions. The technology used is Ruby on Rails and we will be releasing a developers kit for folks interested in building apps on hmpgr.<p>Why would you build apps on hmpgr? Because you are guaranteed atleast one user (that&#x27;s me :). Just kidding. Hopefully its going to be much more than that.
The idea is to easily get attention of fellow users who are already on hmpgr platform. The system gives you the option to install&#x2F;uninstall apps on your choice basis.<p>Obviously, the system has bugs and am still working on them so use them and give me feedback.<p>Great idea @cjbarber.

The intention here is that the user has expressed their choice of not having that app running any more for any reason, so we honor that.<p>In this situation, there&#x27;s really nothing that you can do.  The next time the user launches the app you can let them know that some of the data may be missing, although you really cannot tell whether there&#x27;s missing data or not (i.e. you might have been killed by the OS in the background and the user may not have moved thereby not triggering any SLC notifications).

3385952,,comment,andralex,2011-12-23 15:35:08,"As a Facebook employee who holds a PhD, I can say we are constantly preoccupied about improving the quality of our interview process. In particular, the topic of how to adapt the interview process advanced degree holders comes about quite often. For example, I recall we recently discussed that we should offer PhD candidates the option to give a talk about their research. (The option is indeed available.)<p>That being said, I think a dismissive or patronizing attitude towards a coding interview would be mistaken. Allow me to explain.<p>It is quite well known that the ability to code is poorly correlated with holding an advanced degree or other formal pieces of evidence. A candidate with strong credentials understands this and should, therefore, not be in the least offended by being asked coding questions. As a good professional, the strong candidate would handle the questions with panache and should be ready for more difficult questions, discussing advanced topics linked to the question at hand, or discussing her particular area of expertise. Either way, she must be able to code her way out of a paper bag, and I see nothing wrong with the interview process probing for that.<p>I've interviewed a few dozen engineers while at Facebook, many with advanced degrees (because recruiters pair as well as they can interviewers with interviewees for areas of expertise), some from top 10 universities. I ask 2-4 coding questions extracted from my daily job, starting from undergraduate level and on rare occasions ending with a difficult complexity question. Nobody has ever done perfectly well, and for a variety of reasons holding an advanced degree doesn't correlate strongly with doing well.<p>All in all, I think you'd be mistaken to believe two weeks of rote memorization would be enough to pass the Facebook interview, which is very difficult. Overall, an attitude of professionalism, modesty, and focus helps a lot in any interview.",3371697,,,,,

Even the smallest of these land grant universities—the University of Vermont at Burlington, or Wyoming’s isolated campus at Laramie—can boast collections, resources, facilities, and ambitions that most ancient European establishments can only envy.[fn1]</i><p>&#62; <i>...</i><p>&#62; <i>My own perspective is still colored by that year in Davis. Originally the agricultural extension of the University of California, precariously perched amid the rice paddies of the Sacramento River delta—halfway between San Francisco and nowhere in particular—UC Davis now boasts 3.3 million volumes, a world-class research faculty, and the country’s leading green energy program. Some of the most interesting colleagues I know have spent their lives in Davis. At the time, however, this was a mystery to me: the year completed, I retreated cautiously to the Olde English familiarity of Cambridge. But nothing was quite the same. Cambridge itself felt somehow reduced and constricting: the pancake-flat Fenland as remote as any rice paddy. Everywhere is somewhere else’s nowhere.</i><p>&#62; <i>[fn1]: By way of comparison, the University Library in Cambridge, England, boasts just seven million volumes; the University of Vienna (founded in 1365) just 6.6 million.</i>",1685677,{1686103},,,,

1585731,,comment,jordanmessina,2010-08-08 18:50:18,"I've been an iPhone fanboy (I admit it) since the first generation.  I even waited in line for 13 hours for the iPhone 3g.  I've spent over $1000 on iPhones and accessories now (I've probably made most of it back considering I sell the old one when I get a new one).  I was completely dedicated to Apple and its magical phone.  But one day I got a little curious.  A friend of mine got the Droid and was in love with it.  I figured that I should at least give the Android platform a shot so as soon as Google announced the Nexus One for AT&#38;T I had it ordered and in my hands the next day.  I must admit at first I was incredibly angry with the UI, it felt very clunky.  Also the touchscreen keyboard was awful and wasn't even close to the accuracy of the iPhone's keyboard.  After the first two days with the phone I was a little depressed that I had really just shelled out $500 for this junk.<p>I stuck with it though, and the Nexus One eventually grew on me.  What I started to realize was that it was a phone that wasn't built to be pretty or cute but rather useful.  For example, all alerts that came in I would know about via the trackball lighting up a particular color (I had red=text or missed call, green=email, blue=twitter @reply).  The status bar also made it very easy to see what was happening on my phone without ever having to actually unlock it.  Finally I didn't constantly have to unlock my phone, go to app X and see what just came in.  Because the marketplace is so lenient, I found everything I could ever want in regards to apps.  Wifi Hotspot creator,  LED Flashlight app, NES emulator, eBook readers, etc.  It's all there and the majority are free.  I never paid for one app on my Nexus One and it did so much more than any iPhone I ever owned.  Sure, the apps are never quite as polished but you get over it and start appreciating the functionality. On top of that, being allowed to put whatever I want on my phone by simply mounting the SD card is amazing.  Not having to deal with iTunes BS was so liberating.<p>Unfortunately, Jobs did an amazing job of hyping the iPhone4 and I switched back over.  I've never been more disappointed in my life.  I dropped maybe 2 calls the entire time I had the Nexus One.  Literally the first call I made on my new iPhone4 was dropped within a minute.  The antenna problem was real, and it almost ended my current relationship.  My girlfriend stopped talking to me on the phone and resorted to texts only.  Thanks Steve!  After being spoiled by the usefulness of Android the iPhone feels like such a toy.  You can only see one push notification at a time, if another notification comes in the last one is erased, I feel like they force me to be using the phone at all times or else I'm going to miss something.  I can't even switch back because I sold my Nexus One to my roommate, who rubs it in every chance he gets.<p>At least my free bumper came in yesterday.  Oh did I mention with the new bumper I can't use any standard 1/8"" headphone jack other than Apple's ear buds?  So every time I want to listen to music I have to take the bumper off...awesome.",1585449,"{1586373,1586312}",,,,

4335057,,comment,ChuckMcM,2012-08-03 18:29:50,"Absolutely true that 'tight deadlines' and 'meetings' are anathema. After all you're not working if you are 'meeting'.<p>That said, the thing that most affects delivery schedules are communication delays between inter-dependent people or groups. I really got to appreciate this at NetApp when a project was spread across two teams, one based out of Bangalore India and the other in Sunnyvale California. The 12 hr delay that occurred during non-overlapping sleep schedules tripled the length of time the project took.<p>The mechanism is a variation on the makers schedule / managers schedule problem which pg discusses nicely in his essay on the topic [1]. The essence of that is that ""makers"" have a synchronization time, when they change gears. Think of it as a 'makers near / makers far' issue and it has properties that are remarkably similar to computer memory synchronization issues. Engineer is cranking along on some part of the project and hit a problem in some other engineers part of the system. If they can turn/walk over and start talking to them they carry their context in their heads, discuss, resolve, and keep cranking. If on the other hand the other engineer is 'far' and not immediately available, they have to stop, create an imperfect summary, message it out, and then wait. The 'far' engineer gets the message, reads the summary, then responds with questions (generally the first engineer who has the whole picture in their head leaves stuff out of the summary) and those go back, which then interrupt the first engineer in what they were now doing so they task switch back into that original problem, add additional detail to the summary and respond, maybe at that point they can pick up the phone and call (not often to India but certainly for a remote office in the same time zone that works). And the process continues. The problem gets resolved and our original engineer is off and running again. Often times people won't even really realize how much time they are spending synchronizing as opposed to working.<p>The more intertwined the system these folks are working on is, the more these synchronization points occur, and the more they risk slowing everything down.<p>So if the problem is 'things are not getting done in a timely way' and the cause is engineers being spending time being stuck waiting for some time with another engineer who knows the part of the system they are stuck on, the solution is more rapid communication between engineers. You can focus on fixing that issue. Sometimes just having an IRC channel where folks can talk is enough, sometimes you need something more. Sometimes a sync meeting is the correct answer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html</a>",4334895,,,,,

3635967,,comment,kevinalexbrown,2012-02-26 16:40:42,"At first, I really agreed with this piece. I think it's an awesome point that the overuse of the word innovative deflates its meaning, just like calling every programmer a ""hacker"" or saying ""let's do this 'the hacker way!'"" makes it less meaningful, or calling every member of the military a 'national hero' is maybe a little degrading to purple-heart recipients.<p>But on a second reading, this article really uses a straw man. Comparing a facebook and a few cherry-picked innovations from Bell Labs is a little disingenuous for a few reasons.<p>The most obvious comes from the fact that there were a <i>lot</i> of people working at Bell Labs. See that first picture? Halls so long they ended in the vantage point? There were a <i>lot</i> of ideas that never quite made a splash in the 70 years of Bell Lab's heyday.<p>The second part is that the innovations of Bell Labs may not have been lost, but transferred. There's still quite a lot of research done in this country, although most of hit has slowly been shifting to universities. I'm not sure if this is better, but no one can say there isn't tons of cool stuff being done for the ""understanding"" and not the short-term profit. I think there should be more, but that's not the point. While we're cherry-picking, I might point out brain machine interfaces that let monkeys (and soon humans) control prosthetic limbs <i>directly from their brains</i>, nano-scale machines a few molecules large, quantum computers. These things are anything but short-term profit focused, and everything but falsely innovative.<p>Finally, the real straw man lies with the fact that Bell Labs has the benefit of hindsight.  We now know the transistor was an incredibly useful invention. Before we knew what we could really do with computers, it wasn't quite so obvious. It might end up that facebook doesn't turn out anything more innovative than extremely well executed social networking, but that's going to take more than 8 years to find out.<p>Don't overuse innovation, but don't become so narrowmindedly awed by the past that you don't take part in the tumult of things that might (or might not) share the same sentences as the transistor when someone write an article in 30 years wondering why we don't have the same pizzazz as those Silicon Valley entrepreneurs at Google.",3635489,{3636051},,,,

Unless I missed something, not a single statement was backed up with actual data. The only study mentioned in the entire article was in the context of ad copy and was done over 30 years ago (I'm assuming they're referring to a study from Ogilvy on Advertising [1] but I could be wrong).<p>For example:<p><i>If the images you’re using are not clearly tied to your value proposition, or to the central theme of your page, then they will only confuse your readers. At best, they’ll be pointless distractions. At worst, they’ll give the wrong impression and lead readers to feel tricked or disappointed.</i><p>In my experience, the blog posts I've written gain much more traction when they have images, even pointless stock images (I have experimented with this). So while I agree, that ideally, images should provide actual value to the story, I've found that a couple pointless stock images are better than no images. This is why I would have <i>really</i> liked to see actual evidence to back up their claims.<p>EDIT: Also, while we're on the topic, I also hate including all those social sharing widgets, but viewership takes a dramatic hit when they're not there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X</a>",3635459,{3636326},,,,

I'm not here to claim that the U.S. legal system is 100% appropriate to the task, but instead that the prosecutors are going to the job with the resources that they have. If Congress significantly reduces the category and criteria of what counts as crimes by getting rid of the stupid stuff then great, but that's not the system the prosecutors are in now.<p>&#62; Maybe we could get expedience by, you know, focusing prosecution effort on serious crimes or ones that actually have victims.<p>Do you have any specific cases in mind involving serious crimes or crimes with more deserving victims (since apparently MIT doesn't count) that were <i>not</i> prosecuted due to the resources needed being assigned to the Swartz case?<p>&#62; You might want to read up on how plea bargaining is viewed in other countries.<p>Please don't take this the wrong way but I don't operate my life based on opinion polls.

I spent most of 6 years working with the entrepreneur behind Bluewall (<a href=""http://www.bluewallmedia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bluewallmedia.com/</a>). I worked there 2002-2008 (on and off).

(We built a decent video store for the yoga site <a href=""http://www.ihanuman.com/store.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ihanuman.com/store.php</a> and we could have used the same software to build out a whole network of similar niche/community focused video sites.)<p>I saw a lot of projects abandoned, some of which seemed to have big potential.

However, startup experiences are unique and not easily fungible for other experiences. The question then, simply, is whether you want startup experiences. If not, then you probably should not be working at startups at all, even if the pay was great.

2934451,,comment,dredmorbius,2011-08-28 18:42:35,"Spam filtering is a wicked problem. The solutions are contextual, and there's no one single tool that will slay the dragon.<p>That said, a great many anti-spam solutions work by well-known and publicly available methods.  DKIM (header signing) actually utilizes PKI.  DNSBLs are publicly queryable (in some cases the zonefiles may be downloaded), Bayesian and rules-based filters are also generally available.<p>The real challenges are:<p>1. Spam is cheap. Spam mail outnumbers ham (non-spam mail) by 100:1 or better. There's a lot of it.<p>2. Distinguishing spam from ham is contextual, and people's contexts differ.<p>3. False positives are expensive. Wrongly classifying ham as spam carries far worse consequences than wrongly classifying spam as ham (false negatives). Filters must skew to permissive.<p>4. There's little central agreement on methods, there are many old systems in existence.  We've seen a few small advances (DKIM, SPF) in the past decade, but brute-force content filtering is still required.<p>5. Even well-established strong verification tools are too technically advanced for the vast majority of the userbase, and/or are unappealing to others.  PGP MIME-encoded email signatures (strong cryptographic identity verification) dates to 1991, fer crissakes!  Getting even corporate-supported users to employ this properly is at best difficult (though it's becoming ever so slightly more common largely due to compliance requirements). For others, repudiability is important.<p>6. It's an arms race.  Spammers change methods (many based on automated tools assuring rapid widespread adoption of new methods) based on new anti-spam methods.<p>7. Client and server (MUA/MTA) support for tools which would facilitate whitelisting of users and mail peers is difficult. Centralizing mail gateways can complicate the issue if those core gateways emit proportionately high levels of spam (I see or have seen middlin' amounts of spam from Hotmail, Yahoo, GMail, AOL, and other large email service providers, though generally they're pretty good).<p>That said:  whitelisting, reputation systems (sender, server, DKIM, SPF), authentication (DKIM, PGP), contextual (Bayesian), and rules-based (e.g.: SpamAssassin) properly used do make the situation tenable. But this requires extensive support largely for the administrator of an email gateway. End-users may be forgiven for thinking spam is a ""solved problem"", though at their level it largely is.<p>What ultimately will solve the email spam problem will be for email to be superseded by another communications channel (SMS, weblogs, social sites, etc.) to the extent that spammers focus their energies there. It's an economic problem, and if the economics fail to support spamming, the (smart) spammers will move elsewhere.",2933802,,,,,

Distribute your own root cache to your 'clients' put a copy of the root servers for the domains you care about into your machines and recursively resolve the rest with the regular system.<p>At one time this would have been prohibitively expensive but with Amazon's EC-2 service you could run a separate namespace for about a million customers easily for $600/month maybe less.",4536121,,,,,

Why do you think that it would make sense for me to try to write up and publish a paper on arXv?<p>My view is that doing so would take a considerable amount of work.  And the real-world constraints that matter to my clients don't seem to be in a direction that academics care much about, so I can't see them getting particularly interested in it.  So it does not seem like it positively impacts my life.<p>I say this as someone who has several publications to my name.  This fact has only once mattered to me.  That once was when I needed to get sign-off from my current employer to have something I did before they hired me get published.  Unfortunately my employer at the moment was eBay, they had just purchased Skype, and the paper that I was publishing among other things implied that Skype was unlikely to be worth what eBay had paid for it.  This was..not fun.<p>If some research mathematician particularly wanted to sit down, pick my brains, and try to formalize the real-world constraints I've observed in my clients, that would be fine by me.

I'd imagine that there are only a handful of scientists around the globe who have worked directly with exploding nuclear devices, and even fewer who have studied the effects such explosions on underwater geology. There are entire fields of study dedicated to the effects of explosions on geology, but they deal with relatively small explosions, and the results simply don't scale to things like 30 kiloton nuclear detonations.<p>For me, this is what makes the answer a ""no"".

They do it prevent wage inflation in America.  If they can get comparable work( and you can get it from India if you manage it right) at nearly the same cost, they reduce the demand for similar jobs in America.<p>As to the specific answer , yes it does work.

The problem is that - as you said - there are so many different XSS vectors in the browser; if you patch one specific use case then the exploiter will just find another.   Browser developers aren't avoiding this problem; they just realize how complicated it is and have to approach it slowly to do it right, and to not break compatibility.<p>Your &#60;noscript_within&#62; tag is something that I'm sure every browser developer (and web app developer) has thought up at some point. It does not resolve this problem. It would only protect a site in the case that a website allowed <i>all</i> user input to be passed directly onto the page unedited.   Your solution would require app developers to allow commenters the full range of HTML (including blink, marquee, and who knows what else) in their comments.  Because once the app developer starts to try to filter the commenter's input, he's opening himself up to an exploit that allows the filtered output to contain a &#60;/noscript_within&#62; tag.<p>The simplest example would be an app developer who simply deleted all &#60;marquee&#62; tags because he/she wanted to disallow marquees.  The script kiddie would just insert &#60;/noscript_&#60;marquee&#62;within&#62; into his comment.<p>The more complicated examples would be things that neither you nor I have thought of yet.<p>That doesn't even take into account the exploit of users in legacy web apps who could potentially start passing in unclosed &#60;noscript_within&#62; tags (in apps which allow HTML but filter only certain tags) to disable legitimate JS later in the page, breaking the apps.  Of course, it would be possible to only enable &#60;noscript_within&#62; based on doctype or something else, but then it's certain that some web developers will accidentally forget to do so and leave their app open to abuse.<p>You are oversimplifying the problem.

It should be illegal to copy someone else's digital goods and sell them for a profit (ie. copying a cd whether you paid for the original or not and reselling it). That doesn't mean I think copyright holders need to be compensated in the same way they have in the past. We're in the midst of trying to figure out how exactly to do that. Louis CK's movie, Radiohead's In Rainbows, Kickstarter... they're all examples of people trying to figure out how this all works moving forward. Some of it works, some of it doesn't.

I tend to prefer Dojo as far as frameworks, so i will use dojo.byId or dijit.byId to grab references to my nodes in my page init function.<p>I intentionally make my controller file procedural and then I have a custom life-cycle event controller that fires off events for  page init, reload, load data, page unload, etc.. so my developers can just fill in the blanks. Any data access is done by calling methods on a service facade which again is purposefully procedural.  The service facade then calls any server side services we need (we don't do form posts any more, JSON is far more robust for submitting data). Finally, we use Dijit for any of our widget and any of our model / utility / OO needs.<p>I know it's no purely JavaScript best practices, and it is more related to project file layout and architecture, but I find it gives me the best architecture for my team size (100+). It helps me on-board people quickly and graduate their skill set while maintaining clean code and allowing advanced features.<p>I can start a junior on pure html layout, then we can train them to do controller modification, then to work on service facades and then when they have a good foundation in prototype base OO we can graduate them into building reusable widgets and subsystems for the controller and service facade developers. It works well and allows developers to work proficiently at their skill set without mucking up the whole system.<p>As well the service facades make it easy to contract out entire web projects while my internal team builds server side services to support the effort.

I don't think the aim is to charge students for courses like ai-class, but rather quite the opposite.<p>It would look to me like the idea is to create a platform to allow universities to create their own version of ai-class.
MIT gains a lot of positive press from OCW but it must cost them at least a little staff time and money to maintain and run it.  I would guess there is definitely a market for a company to claim ""Hey we're the guys behind Standford's famous AI class experiment, and for a price that saves you a lot of work and staff time you can have that same, well known, platform today""<p>Having worked in Universities for years, I know that at the institutional level 'buy-it' almost always trumps 'built-it'.",3185188,{3186666},,,,

There are a lot of Web devs who can make a site that renders in the browser and mostly works, but can't wrap their minds around the difference between server-side code and client-side. Browse through the JavaScript tag on Stack Overflow and you'll come across more than you can shake a stick at. Many people (either due to willful ignorance or a sad gap in their education) write functions like:<p><pre><code>    function getTime() {
      &#60;?php return time(); ?&#62;
    }
</code></pre>
It's not at all improbable that somebody told them their site was vulnerable to SQL injection, so they took a brief glance at the Wikipedia page and said, ""I know, I'll just stop people from writing this stuff."" So they open up the page where people might be entering the malicious text and write some code that will stop them. They run it in their browser and it works — none of their SQL strings make it through.

Since you can not tell with any certainty that a specific Zerocoin is already redeemed ( except if all are redeemed, more on that later), the probability that a specific Zerocoin belongs to you is 1/n, where n is the number of addresses which have ever generated Zerocoins.<p>However, there are some assumptions in the argument, most importantly that the number of Zerocoins is always rising. Dropping this assumption ( and mentioning that I did not double check my argument), the probability that the last redeemed Zerocoin is also the last minted is 1/min( n(t) + m(t)), where n(t) denotes the number of addresses which generated Zerocoins since some time t and m(t) is the number of not redeemed Zerocoins at t. At least from the perspective of an outside observer who does not hold any Zerocoins. In the case of an attacker with f Zerocoins the probability would be 
    P=1/min(n(t)+m(t)-f).<p>The worst case is then, that your adversary holds all Zerocoins just before you mint your Zerocoin. And a attacker with large resources can continue to mint Zerocoins until he runs out of funds, simulating a working anonymising ecosystem. Therefore you should wait until a plausible attacker runs out of funds, that is for a attacker with total funds f0 (using the above formula at the time of your minting of a coin t=0 with m(0)=f)
    P0 &#62; 1/(n(t) - (f0-m(0)).
where PO is a parameter describing your desired anonymity level. And therefore you should wait for the minting of 
    n(t)&#62; 1/P0 + (f0 - m0) 
Zerocoins before you redeem your originally minted one. Simple corollary, you should mint when there are many coins in existence and you should pick poor enemies.",5535709,{5536710},,,,

5886086,,comment,StefanKarpinski,2013-06-15 20:47:00,"Interesting comparison. A couple of points:<p>1. Fortran code being 2x slower than anything for array operations means you&#x27;re not using Fortran right. So this result says more about f2py generating bad Fortran code than anything else. Labeling that as &quot;Fortran&quot; is disingenuous – it should be labeled &quot;f2py&quot;.<p>2. I&#x27;m surprised that SciPy and Scikit aren&#x27;t faster than this. You can use clever techniques to compute pairwise distances asymptotically faster than the naïve loop approach. For example, see the Julia Distance.jl package [1], which gets a 125x speedup [2] over a naïve loop implementation for computing pairwise Euclidian distances. I haven&#x27;t done a direct comparison but for simple scalar loops like this, Julia has C-speed, which means its naïve version would be about the same as Numba and Cython and the Distance.jl version would be correspondingly faster. Of course, the amount of speedup depends on the shape of the matrices, so 125x speedup might not happen in this particular case.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindahua&#x2F;Distance.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindahua&#x2F;Distance.jl</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindahua&#x2F;Distance.jl#pairwise-benchmark"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindahua&#x2F;Distance.jl#pairwise-benchmark</a>",5885941,"{5886118,5887131,5886688}",,,,

The films advertised on billboards aren't typically the ones that advance the medium creatively.
Games are no different.<p>The problem with Braid is that it wasn't that innovative.
Nice art style, sure.
But is a 2d-platformer so revolutionary?
Time-based play elements weren't new either.<p>So it was a well-built, good looking game, based on established mechanics, with a great story.
Not a revolution in gaming though.<p>There are far more progressive games out there, which are far further removed from the world of the Blockbusters.
On that basis I'd say that Blow is nice to have around, but he's no messiah, and not as essential to the medium as is suggested.
I'd go so far as to say his attitude actually propogates the stereotype of the surly, antisocial gamer.<p>Some examples:<p>Amnesia - pure distilled terror in a way no other medium can achieve, a proof of the unique value of games<p>Minecraft - a game with no purpose, pure zen, which stuck two fingers up to fancy graphics (and it's sales proved the market for such games)<p>Child of Eden - an absolutely beautiful game which connects the player with music<p>Anyone want to add some of their favourite progressive games?",3834203,,,,,

3435831,,comment,chunky1994,2012-01-07 01:22:40,"Okay, so let me be a bit clearer.
This is the advice I got from a hermit who has been practicing Yoga for 22 years, and teaching for 14.
He specifically told me that initially Yoga (particularly Hatha Yoga) is meant to help you with your everyday postures, such as standing and sitting, and breathing correctly.<p>That part <i>is</i> easy, but it requires practice. The Yoga postures are not really the essence of Yoga for a beginner. It's only the correction of your everyday postures. That is what I said should be done alone, from a book. That is what the body can handle, and you will not be hurting yourself. Again, this is truly expert advice, and you may follow it if you feel it is.<p>The <i>hard</i> part of Yoga is undoubtedly dangerous to pursue alone, but <i>even</i> more dangerous to pursue with a teacher who does not know what he/she is doing. So, even though this seems like a Kobiyashi Maru, I would advise finding a really good teacher first, and if that doesn't work, and you <i>really</i> have to do Yoga (for whatever reasons) you're better of doing it on your own, with instructions from a really good book. By no means do I say doing it alone should be your first option.",3433818,,,,,

It is because the government backed off what many called ""over-regulation"" that we are in the very mess we are in!""</i><p>This may be what some website with an agenda told you, but unfortunately reality is a little more complicated than that.  This crisis has a number of causes and the economists who have been studying it from the beginning still don't fully understand it.  True, the repeal of certain regulations was an important factor.  But another important cause was excessive encouragement by the government for homeownership.  This sort of ""over-regulation"" was certainly disastrous.<p>The point this article is trying to make is that the notion of ""spontaneous order"" is fundamental to both the theory of evolution and the free market.  One would be hard pressed to design from scratch a working flamingo, and one would similarly be hard pressed to design from scratch a working economy.  Both are extremely complicated systems and one cannot make a change to a single part without watching the consequences ripple out to affect seemingly distant parts of the system.<p>In the case of biology we can perform experiments so that we can isolate the specific effects of a particular action.  This is what makes medicine work.  A pharmaceutical company does not make the right drug on its first go--it tries thousands of chemicals before getting anything that works.  Unfortunately, we cannot do this in the economy--it won't fit in a test tube.  If Congress changes a certain regulation, the effects of this change will be felt in distant parts of the economy in ways that no one could have predicted.  But because we can never have a ""control economy,"" we will never be able to figure out what those effects were, exactly.  In effect, we're hoping that we can come up with the right drug on the first go.  This is nothing more than the Law of Unintended Consequences.  Perhaps there exist certain regulations that would make the economy run more efficiently--but until we can apply the scientific method to the economy, we will never be able to definitively determine what they are.",635236,{635406},,,,

To me your post seems to be ""I sort of like computers and my life isn’t working out the way I want so I now want to pursue computers because it looks like my best chance out of the life I’m living""<p>Well, sorry to say, that isn’t how it works.  Don’t get me wrong, if you really work at it I’m sure you can do it but you are WAY behind the curve if you’re 20 years old and have done nothing but tinker with BASIC and C.  That said here's my advice...<p>First, accept you need to work day and night to accomplish your goal.  Again, you’re already way behind so you have a lot of catch up to do just to be competent.  You should be looking at 70 to 80 hour weeks of pure hard work (including your grocery job).<p>Second, learn Python (or some other language) backwards and forwards before you even start anything else.  Tinkering doesn’t prove anything.  Anyone can write a ""hello world"" app but true programmers have to think in a very specific, logical fashion.  You might not have the aptitude for that and there’s no point wasting time pursuing this goal if you’ll never be able to get good at it.   You can learn everything you need to know with a search engine these days so there’s no excuse here.<p>Third, stop thinking in generalizations.  No one succeeds by saying ""I want to found a start up.""  You need to latch on to an actual idea and you need to start working on it as soon as you are able.  From where you live and the experience you have I figure you’ll need to create a whole product just to interest anyone.<p>Again, I apologize for the harsh tone but I think it’s justified.  As rude as it sounds someone who gets in your position usually doesn’t get out.  Getting out will not only be the hardest thing you ever do it will be close to the hardest thing anyone’s ever done.  You literally have to remake yourself at a time when many of your instincts have already been formed.  It’s not easy, it’s not fun and it will be tons of work and tons of time before you see even a little bit of results.<p>But if you want to succeed you have to commit yourself to that reality.",635192,"{635485,635486,635476,635375,635346}",,,,

Spend cash in the right places.  Like health insurance.<p>3. Never interrupt a good salesperson in the middle of their pitch, even if they are saying something incorrect.  Tell them afterwards, and if it's important enough they can always call the customer/investor and clear it up.<p>4. Read contracts.  A lot of the time they don't make sense.  Sentences go on forever.  Don't take that crap.  Make a lawyer spell things out and simplify.  Make sure you read and understand every detail, particularly investment agreements.  
These people are not your friends.  
They are not your parents.  
They are not looking out for your best interests.  
Your lawyer isn't either.  Lawyers are just making sure you are not going to get sued and such.  They are not looking out for your best business interests.  Do not think because a lawyer says a contract is 'pretty good' that the lawyer has evaluated the business implications of it.<p>5. Don't listen to accountants when they say the word 'profit'.  It's an illusion.  It doesn't necessarily mean you made money.  You could in fact have ended the year or month with less cash (and assets) than you had at the beginning, which sound to me like an unprofitable year or month, but they will take numbers from an accrued loss and add them up to make profit.  
This kind of profit isn't going to help you pay rent or hit payroll.  And savy investors can read through it.  Cash is all that matters.  
So when a suit* say 'cash is king', which is often their 'advice', what they really mean is focus on the cash flow, not the balance sheet.<p>*a 'suit' is someone who has started a few companies and is quite successful, but doesn't remember the early nitty gritty days of suffering and fear, so they like to say things like 'cash is king' to summarize all their mistakes of running out of cash.<p>6. Figure out how to make and read a cash flow and balance sheet.  It's like a doctors chart for a business.  If you have no revenue, and you have 'project' revenue in your cash flow chart, make 2 more.  One with no projected revenue, and one with 1/3 what you projected.  
This tells you how long your company will survive in the worst case and most likely case scenario.  Chances are your actual revenue will be 1/2 to 1/3 of what you expect it to be (in the beginning, with no history or trends, and a brand new product in a new market)  The more prepared you are for this the more likely chance you'll have of surviving.<p>And, if your 100% right, you have better problems to solve than running out of money.  :)",184088,,,,,

Hell, don't you think Intel would be doing this with their multi-core processors if it was a legitimate statistic? (a point I've made several times now but you keep ignoring).<p>You've been told by a multitude of people what the correct measure of cumulative processing power is, and instead you're still holding onto the same myth which the clickbait headlines are perpetuating. So really, you're just reinforcing my point about how they shouldn't be using such a dumb statistic because people who don't know any better will fall for it.<p>Anyway, and FYI, core frequency isn't even a good measure of CPU performance on single core systems. A 1GHz RISC CPU will perform vastly differently to a 1GHz CISC. Then you have the plethora of RISC architectures; and even on x86, different CPUs will have different co-processors, caching, pipelining and even additional instructions, thus will perform differently on different stress tests.<p>So crudely summing clock frequencies on a cluster is about as accurate a description of performance as remarking on the colour of the motherboard. But let's not let a pesky thing like science get in the way of our deeply held beliefs ;)",4585802,{4587232},,,,

This meant that for invoking Ruby methods and other things like accessing instance variables could not take advantage of many of the JVM's features such as method inlining.<p>Since HotSpot is unaware of Ruby semantics, invoking Ruby methods involved a bunch of custom logic implemented in the form of bytecodes which were completely opaque to HotSpot and thus could not be optimized away.<p>InvokeDynamic allows JRuby to teach the JVM how to invoke Ruby methods in a way that plays friendly with the HotSpot inliner.

Charge for post.<p>* Wedding Website (incl gallery!)<p>* Gift management (use a partner)<p>Then you can add:<p>* Make deals with Photographers, possibly vet them.

If you increase their profits then they'll evangelise your site.<p>* Wedding plans / inspiration.  Nice because you can sell stuff there (via partners).<p>* Directory for Wedding locations: it was hard finding good pictures and prices of wedding locations.<p>* Directory for Reception locations: same problem as Wedding Locations.  This is also a more general problem, the discoverability of these places is terrible.<p>* Diversify into cards.  This'll be a massive win for men: never forget your wedding anniversary again.

A large number of small teams working on many different problems will by definition have a great variance in outcomes just by random extraneous factors (also known as the law of small numbers and insensitivity to sample size).<p>&#62; <i>A certain town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital about 45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 15 babies are born each day. As you know, about 50% of all babies are boys. However, the exact percentage varies from day to day. Sometimes it may be higher than 50%, sometimes lower.<p>For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. Which hospital do you think recorded more such days?<p>1) The larger hospital<p>2) The smaller hospital<p>3) About the same (that is, within 5% of each other)<p>56% of subjects chose option 3, and 22% of subjects respectively chose options 1 or 2. However, according to sampling theory the larger hospital is much more likely to report a sex ratio close to 50% on a given day than the smaller hospital.<p>Relative neglect of sample size were obtained in a different study of statistically sophisticated psychologists</i><p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitivity_to_sample_size"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitivity_to_sample_size</a><p>&#62; <i>A deviation of 10% or more from the population 
proportion is much more likely when the sample size is small. 
Kahneman and Tversky concluded that ""the notion that sampling variance 
decreases in proportion to sample size is apparently not part of man's 
repertoire of intuitions. For anyone who would wish to view man as a reasonable 
intuitive statistician such results are discouraging.""</i><p>-- <a href=""http://www.decisionresearch.org/pdf/dr36.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.decisionresearch.org/pdf/dr36.pdf</a><p>Taking lessons as gospel from these ""10x"" events is by definition foolhardy and merely an extension of the bullshit pushed by the entire ""Good To Great"" Jim Collins business book industry.<p>It's like taking lessons from survivors of the Titanic on how to survive the sinking of a ship. It's quite simple - be a young female child with a life vest and rich parents (or in startup land - a young upper-middle class male living in California during a venture bubble, a cyclical investment in the Valley with a convergence of secondary technologies, above average intelligence and a college degree from a reputable university).<p>I have a personal rule with any kind of advice or explanation coming out of anyone working in a ""soft"" industry - if it's vague - it's bullshit. All of the advice given at these events are bullshit by this definition. So are many other things - and yeah it doesn't preclude me from spouting it. Or using the advice at my discretion.<p>But honestly - startup founders literally have no idea why things take off and they have no idea why they win. That's why they have to keep pivoting - it increases their luck surface area and their ability to gain traction  - after which they simply must hold on tight while surfing the wave.<p>YouTube was a dating site - didn't work - pivot - video traction - venture up - ride.<p>PayPal was a Palm Pilot app - didn't work - pivot - traction  - venture up - ride.<p>Google sold corporate search - didn't work - pivot - copy PPC from Overture - lever up - traction hits - ride.<p>Instagram - started with a location checking HTML5 app 2 years too early - pivot - copy PicPlz and Hipstamatic - hit traction - lever up - ride.<p>Angry Birds - fail at hitting nearly every game in the past decade - pivot - take a shot at the iPhone - hits traction - lever up - ride.<p>Of the startups that didn't pivot - they either skipped the pivot thanks to previous side projects/companies or already had traction - and all they had to do was lever up and ride.<p>I'm going to make this clear - there is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with this - not at all - it is merely reality and not particularly unfair.<p>People stating pointless platitudes that success is due to things like ""Be 10x more productive"", ""Commitment"" and ""People, product, and philosophy"" are simply wasting their breath, other people's time and confusing what actually happens. These things may or not be either actionable, predictive or sufficient for success.<p>Here's my list of startup advice:<p>Be alive. Be male. Be young. Don't have health issues. Be born in America or move there. Enter the cycle after a recession. Speak English. Enter a growing/new field where the level of competition is low and so is the sophistication of your competition. Surf cost trends down from expensive to mass consumer markets. Work bottom up - on small things. Be of above average intelligence. Have family support. Have a college degree.<p>Oh and most importantly of all: Get fucking lucky.<p>The hindsight/survivorship biases in combination with faulty causality and the narrative fallacy will completely hose your thinking - so be careful.<p>More interesting stuff:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_decision_making"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases</a><p><a href=""http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2000-05/rabin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2000-05/rabin.pdf</a><p>Disclaimer: Biases rule your thoughts and mine - this post is also subject to both bullshit and biases (mostly bullshit - I do love that word).

Of course, if you are ""selling"" software on the basis of the question ""who are you going to call?"", then you have to embrace the fact that you are not in the software business, you're in the ""You can call me"" business. You're really in the software support business.<p>Everything about your pricing model is really a kind of fiction. The charge up front, the license, everything. It's really a support business, pure and simple. Oracle and IBM know this, and so do their customers.<p>And thus the business proposition as a developer comes down to:<p>1. If I'm in the support business, writing and selling my own software places my customers in thrall to me. I have a monopoly on support. Of course, that means they have a certain risk since I'm the sole vendor. And I have to develop the software and compete with other vendors just to get a customer for my support business, which has a certain risk.<p>2. If I'm in the support business, supporting free software outsources the part of my business that isn't my core value proposition, and lets me focus on the value I charge for.",2185551,,,,,

I personally consider it part of the filter on potential employers. If, as an employer you're not knowledgeable enough to realize this for such an important position then I don't want to work for you anyways. It means I'll be surrounded by peers that aren't in it for the same reasons, and I probably won't have any chance to move up based on merit.<p>Not because I believe having a degree means you aren't a good programmer. Degree or not, I just don't trust it as an indicator of skill either way. 90% of the headhunter's I've run into in the past have no coding background themselves... so why would you entrust them with something so important to your business? You could be scaring off some really great candidates. To me it says your company really doesn't know how important the position is.<p>Granted it's often difficult for very small companies with limited technical resources to make the right hires, but if it's an attractive business and / or great environment we'll find you. Just don't turn us down because we do or don't have a degree. It doesn't mean anything.<p>Granted I'm not a superstar coder, but I'm very passionate about it and work very hard. I can figure out how to do most anything I'd need to for a job.

High fixed monthly fees have been imposed by the underlying banks that provide merchant accounts for years. Some banks have recently relaxed those and Braintree, Stripe and others in the industry are now able to take advantage of it.<p>The reason we were able to waive the fixed fee when you contacted us was not because it was in our discretion the entire time, but because we had only recently been able to get some of those fixed fees removed by the underlying banks. Since that time, we have been proactively contacting hundreds of our customers that would benefit from the new bank structure to offer them lower pricing.<p>The 6% reserve on your transactions wasn't imposed by Braintree but rather the bank that was providing your merchant account (Braintree is not holding back anyone's money). We work extremely hard to prevent reserves being imposed on our merchants and when it does happen, our intent is to get it removed as soon as possible. Please reach out to us so that we can work on getting your funds released asap.<p>We could have handled your situation better, and we're sorry that we weren't able to get lower fees to you faster. We've been browbeating banks for years on behalf of startups to get simpler, better fee structures. We've made a lot of progress and think we've had an impact on the industry with things like simpler pricing and card data portability. That said, we recognize there is a lot more work to do, and we will continue to work hard to provide an exceptional payments experience for startups.",4383754,,,,,

In a signal tap, you want to split the intensity, not the wavelength. In simplest form, telecom signals are at a single wavelength; passing it through a &#x27;Dark side of the moon&#x27; prism will only deflect the beam, not split it.<p>When one refers to a beamsplitter, it&#x27;s usually a partially silvered mirror.<p><a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=914"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thorlabs.us&#x2F;newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=914</a><p>If it&#x27;s fancy, it might use an evanescent wave to do the coupling, as in some cube beamsplitters.<p>Beamsplitters for optical fiber are more generally referred to as &#x27;couplers&#x27; and involve bringing two fiber cores close enough for a long enough distance that the probability of coupling light from one to the other is the desired amount.<p><a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=374"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thorlabs.us&#x2F;newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=374</a><p>It is possible to split beams with a birefringent prism, but it is much less common.<p><a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=745"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thorlabs.us&#x2F;newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=745</a>

Splitting the beam in free space (outside of a fiber) with a prism is far more errorprone, unstable, and no more efficient. A fiber coupler has no moving parts, can&#x27;t break, and won&#x27;t take down a telecom&#x27;s trunk line if someone breathes on it funny.<p>If they&#x27;re actually using a prism, it&#x27;s because of some sort of impedance&#x2F;reflection minimization scheme; I can&#x27;t conjure one that would work better than using simpler techniques though.",6134715,"{6137828,6135037}",,,,

6286465,,comment,rdtsc,2013-08-27 22:37:24,"Good question. Hopefully you have not been put off by that comment. It comes off kind of harsh.<p>She wasn&#x27;t right about lack of concurrency. Go, Scala, Python, hell all of them I guess can do &quot;concurrency&quot;. They all have facilities to launch concurrent requests&#x2F;actors&#x2F;callback threads&#x2F;other processes.<p>Now maybe what she was going to say (and her &quot;how much pain and when&quot; kind of hints in that direction) is that once you start handling large scale concurrency, things get very complicated. Anything that lets you share memory will eventually bite you back in terms of debugging and downtime.<p>Erlang&#x27;s concurrency is unique because its concurrency units are isolated. They are as isolated as possible. Each has its own memory. Garbage collection can happen concurrently. One such what they are called process will not damage or interfere with other processes. That is invaluable.<p>Erlang&#x27;s concurrency just like (Go&#x27;s and Rust&#x27;s I think) is also a mix of both CPU and IO. So behind the scenes Erlang spawns an operating system thread for each CPU core and then it dynamically scales your concurrency units over them. You need to run better, just add more cores.<p>Another (and this should be the main differentiation) is fault tolerance. This was and is the raison-d-etre for Erlang. Nothing practical out there matches it. Processes can and will crash and Erlang has standard ways to supervise and restart. Even crazier it provides built in facilities to reload the code while the system is running. That is of course possible in other frameworks and languages but in Erlang is baked in and battle tested over many years.<p>That sort of makes Erlang a unique tool. It doesn&#x27;t come without trade-offs. It doesn&#x27;t for example has terribly fast sequential speed. So if your task is to multiply matrices for example, or computer lots of numbers. Erlang won&#x27;t be the fastest in that regard. It is also a functional language. It is beautiful I think, especially if you like pattern matching, but some people don&#x27;t like that.<p>But if you don&#x27;t like the syntax, there is  way out, the same Erlang virtual machine called BEAM can run other languages. For example a nice new one is Elixir <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;elixir-lang.org&#x2F;</a> check it out, it is rather similar to Ruby in syntax but includes all the concurrency features from Erlang.<p>As for resources I would recommend the wonderful and funny online book called:<p>Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnyousomeerlang.com&#x2F;</a>",6285701,{6289803},,,,

To remain competitive, cities must use their current competitive advantage to build the next one.  This is more likely to happen if the value created by the current advantage is shared among many agents.<p>Detroit and Pittsburgh suffer b/c too much of their value was held by a few companies.  Cities with a broader base of firms (financial industry in NYC, tech in SV, entertainment in LA, etc) have a better chance to remain competitive over time.  Incidentally, this doesn't bode well for Seattle's long term future as a tech center.  Incidentally, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, etc were incredibly prosperous in their heyday because their competitive advantage was so important and their firms so efficient at creating value from it.  Their fall from that point was therefore that much farther and more poignant.<p>Cities like Cincinatti, St Louis, and Buffalo suffer because their original advantage (access to inland waterways in the US) is less important now that more manufacturing and trade is international.  Ocean port cities like LA, NYC, Tacoma, New Orleans, Tampa, etc have an advantage here.<p>Norway is a good example of using one advantage (North Sea oil and gas) to fund future advantages (education, health care, sovereign wealth fund), while the Texas/Houston energy economy is a good example of how having a rich ecosystem of firms is more stable than a few vertically integrated firms.",984364,,,,,

I think the synergy of having working relationships with other companies are a great asset since they will actively promote you while you promote them and so on.<p>Secondly, do you have any viral aspects / proposition for your site?  I haven't seen it so I can't tell.. But if you positioned yourself such that a small niche group must have and use your site then I think that's a great start since the group will be self-replicated the newly spawned groups will self-replicate more, hence viral.<p>Thirdly, have you looked at the discoverability of your site?  Look for patterns of how your users are finding you and how they are not.<p>Last, SEO is the hot term for these days and I think for a good reason.  Imagine if I did a google search for something related to music and your social website always shows up as #1 / #2 in the search results?  I have a lot of ideas on how this can be done.. but I guess I'll try it out on our stealthy startup first.. and if it works and we become widly successful then I will defintely blog and share about it. =).",386175,,,,,

This website allows them to save all the ads found on different websites (automatically loading all the data). This way the user can more easily see all the ads he is considering and have everything in one place to sort and compare all his/her options.<p>The problem is I can't figure out what keywords I should use that would actually represent what the application does accurately, which is ""a tool for organizing your online searches"" (eg. organize your used car searches, organize your apartment rental searches, organize your search for 'blueberry muffins',etc)<p>I would like to optimize the site so people who are actually looking for such a tool will find it easier in search engines, but I'm not sure what approach I should take. I don't even know what category this web application falls into?<p>Most searches about 'organize' on google are things about physically organizing your garage, home, garden or apartment.

organize car search [1 hit on google]
organize appartment rental search [no results]
organize shopping items [tons of articles about how to organize your groceries]<p>Any ideas on how I can better market this web application, or optimize SEO for this website so I can attract people who are actually looking for such a tool?",,"{1386878,1386633,1386341,1386692,1386433,1387324,1386782}",,5,Ask HN: How to get users/traffic who are actually interested in this webapp?,16

I would call that cable USC (Universal Serial Charger). It looks like a standardization of a power adapter, but I don't think we can call it USB, as the ""serial"" part will not be really used. Profiles 4 and 5 would need special power sources, so you cannot just plug your laptop in a simple desktop (or another laptop) and get 100W of power, so you'll get a brick adapter with an USB plug instead of a custom plug - like most cellphones. But I would not expect the brick to use the initial USB function (data transfer).<p>This also means that the cheap Chinese USB power bricks will be even more dangerous.",4285294,,,,,

I&#x27;m not a physicist, but I spent some time trying to puzzle out how this fits in with my understanding of relativity. So please, correct any misunderstandings.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that the craft is never traveling faster than the speed of light through the space in front of it. But there&#x27;s nothing in relativity that prevents objects from apparently traveling faster than the speed of light &quot;after the fact&quot;. The farthest apart objects that we can see are significantly further apart in light-years than the estimated age of the universe, which is generally thought to be possible because of the expansion of space itself as objects were traveling apart at subluminal speed.<p>I don&#x27;t think that apparent FTL travel violates causality because it doesn&#x27;t allow you to actually reach anything outside of your light cone. It took me a while to understand this, but you can&#x27;t really view the light cone as something that is statically determined at a given point in time, because it depends on the geometry of space as over time. So a craft capable of distorting space just ends up with a really funky-shaped light cone that&#x27;s warped wider than normal out in its direction of travel and narrower in the opposite direction as it moves (if you had a way of externally viewing the curvature of spacetime, which you don&#x27;t).<p>But one thing I could not really figure out is whether this so-called FTL travel has the potential to violate causality, because I don&#x27;t fully understand how causality and FTL are related.",6085768,"{6086259,6086383,6086945,6086698}",,,,

Where I really want to draw a distinction is between values and mutable objects (which may or may not use encapsulation). Encapsulation is a leaky abstraction when applied to mutable objects because the hidden state of some object may impact other parts of the system in various ways. Values (and functions of values) are a much sounder abstraction because they are referentially and literally transparent.<p><i>know nothing about epochal time models</i><p>The epochal time model is a mechanism used to coordinate change in a language which otherwise uses only immutable values (e.g. Clojure). It provides the means to create a reference to a succession of values over time. This means that any one particular list is immutable but the reference itself is mutated to point to different lists over time. The advantage of this is that these references can be shared -- without locks, copying or cloning -- because the succession of values is coordinated atomically.",6085491,,,,,

1135903,,comment,blahblahblah,2010-02-19 01:31:59,"The stuff about the human interface for musical instruments is just hokey.  It lends no support to the author's argument.  Acoustic instruments have the user interfaces that they have because the physics of sound production made more usable interfaces impractical to build.  And, indeed, now that electronics have enabled alternative means of sound production, the design of more intuitive and usable interfaces for musical instruments is an active area of research and development.  Likewise, musical notation is an anachronism that has survived more as a matter of tradition than on the merits of the design.  If you take a look at the design of most MIDI sequencer software, you'll find that piano roll notation has largely replaced traditional music notation as the default interface because it is so much more intuitive.<p>Most people who attempt to learn to play an acoustic instrument take lessons for a few months and eventually quit because the user interfaces are so difficult to learn.  The idea that software should in any way emulate this sort of design is incomprehensible to me, since the design of software is not nearly so constrained as the design of a physical instrument.  On a trumpet, you have to hold down the first and third valve key and extend a slide by a precise amount with your ring finger to play the D above middle C, but the fingering for D an octave higher is completely different.  If you're playing in any kind of a group, you also have to be aware that your instrument is really a B flat instrument and transpose the notes accordingly to play along with everyone else.  If your software had a bizarre interface like this, nobody would buy it unless absolutely no other alternative existed.",1135518,,,,,

So let's assume he follows this and 4 x $60 is his LTV = $240.  With 22 leads from TechCrunch the total potential value of those leads is 22 x $240, not 22 x $60<p>TC leads were potentially worth $5,520 if fully converted (not $1,320 - which is the <i>cost</i> he's willing to pay for equivalent leads)<p>Of course, very rarely do all conversions occur but I think when doing marketing it is important to know the fully converted value of each channel (in this case PR) so that you can figure out how much to spend.  In general $5,000 of potential revenue (or TCV) is my minimum bar for a PR story, for example, so this story makes the cut just barely.  I think the TC traffic they got was pretty abysmal, probably would be worth it to hire PR next time since they've got a B2B product that can afford $60 per warm lead<p>Conversion rates can change and constantly be improved on the product/sales side (public pricing, free trial, free + premium features for upsell, etc) but I've found that often growing the TCV (total converted value) of the channel is more worthwhile than trying to optimize in the early days when fixing conversion is harder than just finding attention opportunities.  If you can find channels that consistently drive you leads worth 10-20x CAC and continue opening the channel more (getting more TC stories for example) you can figure out where its limit it.<p>This topic has been on my mind a lot, needs a whole blog post on DistributionHacks to dig into channel methodology and running multiple experiments to find the TCV of leads for each, stack rank, and implement system for scaling that as a business machine with predictable inputs and outputs --- but I haven't had time.

It's difficult to make you value that until you've tried it.<p>Vim will increase your productivity by allowing you to manipulate large or small pieces of text at will, in ways you've probably not thought of, while your hands rarely leave their position of hovering over the home row. The arrow keys work, but you'll rarely use them. You'll be fast, not from fast typing but from <i>less</i> typing.<p>Once you've become reasonably proficient with vim, the difference between arrow key-based editors and vim begins to feel like the difference between chisels on stone and telekinesis.<p>It's easy to become minimally proficient. After you've installed gvim, run it and run these two commands:<p>[ESC]:help<p>[ESC]:help tutor<p>You should know about the first command, but the second is more important for you right now. It shows you how to start the interactive vim tutorial on your system, which will teach you just enough to use vim better than you can use Notepad++. Follow the tutorial, it won't take long and you don't have to do it all at once.<p>Now use vim whenever you edit a text file. You'll be a little slower than Notepad at first (but not much). You'll quickly gain speed.<p>The vim screencasts mentioned elsewhere in the comments are good for people learning vim, but I don't think they're a great advertisement for vim. The best thing for you is to run the tutorial.<p>Note: everything said here goes for emacs as well. It's a personal choice, and most people are either a vim person or an emacs person. I've never liked the chord-like commands of emacs, but emacs has more integration with the world outside of text editing and compiling than vim. Whichever type of person you turn out to be, you should be using one of these instead of Notepad.<p>Note note: I like vim so much that I've installed a firefox addon that lets me quickly edit web page text fields (like this one) with vim. <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125</a>",1335462,,,,,

1335800,,comment,WiseWeasel,2010-05-10 21:19:09,"Now that Android has somewhat matured and HP is dumping massive resources into WebOS, it may be time for Apple to think about winning hearts and minds again, doing things like allowing iPhone users to install the apps they want to install, including those which carriers and other partners may not be particularly fond of, as Android and WebOS users are able to do.<p>Of course the yearly iPhone release cycle is a big factor, and it can be expected that the product will do relatively poorly at the end of its cycle, but that's also what makes the iPhone so incredibly profitable for Apple. A possible solution to this may be for Apple to have two radically different iPhone models serving different markets, and have the release cycles staggered by six months. Another alternative would be to release a new model every eight months instead of twelve, take a hit in profitability, and still be able to line up with people's two-year plan refreshes, now every three phone models instead of two. Overall, this problem is somewhat mitigated by the attraction of iPhone OS app availability and the iPhone's brand strength, so it may not be the most important issue to address.<p>The other obvious factor is the exclusive carrier agreement with AT&#38;T in the US, with Verizon pouring marketing money into Android to counter Apple's iPhone. Apple is leaving the door wide open for competitors to establish themselves with people who prefer other carriers for various reasons, giving a great boost to Android device vendors. Ending this exclusive distribution agreement as soon as possible seems like the most obvious answer to this competitive pressure.<p>Personally, I recommend people get Android phones because I'm fearful of the power Apple wields over its users (namely me, making me jailbreak my iPhone to run valuable applications that Apple won't allow for whatever reason), and I need credible competition to keep that power in check. I think many technophiles are rooting for and promoting competitors, even if they use iPhones themselves, simply due to Apple's repression of user empowerment with iPhone OS devices. I honestly believe that loosening the reins on their iPhone OS users would afford Apple a whole lot more goodwill with geeks, and remove many of the reservations they have recommending iPhones to people. Making the iPhone more geek-friendly should obviously not be done at the expense of usability for the less geeky, but the value of courting this class of users is to be ignored at Apple's peril, as they are the ones many people trust to guide their purchasing decisions.<p>So that seems about the extent of what Apple can do to turn their fortunes around. It will be interesting to see how this marketshare trend holds in the next year in relation to the iPhone release cycle, ruling out the effect of the end of the current iPhone model's life, compounded by the Gizmodo iPhone 4G leak. There are other obvious areas of improvement in the iPhone OS I'm sure they're working on, such as a workable documents and basic filesystem functionality, but the PR problem surrounding the issue of vendor control over users seems like the critical one for the iPhone at this point. That said, I don't want to take away from this momentous day for Android users, developers and stakeholders.<p>This is a huge milestone for the Android platform, and a watershed moment for mobile app developers. You can bet this is music to the ears of Android devs looking for investment, and that Android will be getting a lot better software for it. It's good to see Apple get a taste of humble pie; they've always done their best work as underdogs, when the pressure is on. Personally, if Apple stays their current course another year, I would expect this trend to be irreversible.<p>Disclosure: I own some AAPL and PALM shares. Sorry for the essay!",1334759,,,,,

The Slashdot diaspora genuinely believes that most of the world&#x27;s computer engineering talent reads their comments.<p>The reality is that not only does money do a fine job of buying talent, but, if it&#x27;s the USG you&#x27;re thinking about, they don&#x27;t even have to try hard; extremely qualified engineering graduates compete to secure positions at NSA, which has been ~10 years ahead of private industry for the last couple decades, before which time they were even further ahead.<p>Part of the reason the USG doesn&#x27;t actually have a problem recruiting people is that actually believe in training people. I don&#x27;t know how effective they really are at it, but I do know that our industry is fundamentally unserious about training. The kinds of commercial organizations that take in raw recruits generally turn out extremely mediocre J2EE and .NET developers. The rest, to a first approximation, run their recruiting programs based on measurements of reproductive organs. Giant defense contractors haul in green IT graduates by the truckload and adapt them to jobs that command significant premiums on the private market. Again, I&#x27;m not saying defense contractors can turn information management grads into electronic supersoldiers, but: they&#x27;re not hurting for recruits.<p>The reason I think you care about this is because it informs you of a hidden handicap that private industry and activist groups have when facing down the government. I&#x27;m very sorry if I&#x27;m the first person to break this to you, but if you&#x27;re an activist targeting the USG, your adversary isn&#x27;t stupid. In fact, I think it&#x27;s likely that they&#x27;re significantly smarter than any of us.

The interesting thing in most cases is what you build on top of that foundation.<p>With Lisps, the value is in the uniformity. That makes it very easy to extend the basic functionality you get out of the box in a way that fits in, using macros and so on.<p>With various other languages, the value is in the pre-built tools that rest on top of some underlying abstract syntax tree. That covers a vast range of functionality these days: more expressive type systems, a wider range of built-in data structures, actor-based concurrency, low-level memory and port access, and numerous other practically useful language features. Hopefully any given language offers a combination of features that work well together and have natural supporting syntax and semantics.

Stego is a good idea, too.  To resist DMCA style censorship and legal liabilities, publish on servers hosted in one of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) -- China being the most resistant unless material is related to China. This should be a linux based webserver with a non-AES encrypted file system.
Set up a ‘workstation’ in a different BRIC country than where you publish.  For less technical people, a MS windows VPS is easiest -- just connect with a remote desktop client.  Then run your tools in the remote environment to manage the publishing server.  Or just run a ssh server on linux, perhaps with port forwarding.  ALWAYS delete the
'workstation' VPS instance when you are finished and create a new one for each use.  ISP’s do not retain this type of log data for long and constantly restarting the VPS makes it hard to track because MAC and IP address info can change.<p>To connect to your ‘workstaion’, start at an internet cafe outside of the district you live in.  From there get an account at a Canadian ISP to be your VPN server.  Avoid accessing this VPN server from the same cafe/place twice or within 20 miles of your home.  Follow published VPN server setup howtos.<p>On the publishing server, create a fake but plausible cover website for the casual browser.  Create a sub-folder that is not linked to or indexed and publish your content here.  Hide your content using public key non-AES/DES algorithms with non-standard key length.  Publishing with stego inside of image files is one example.  Publish
links to your stego encrypted files on public classified ad sites like craig’s list.  Publish info on how to find the craigslist.org ads on forums your audience reads.  Research ‘fast flux DNS’ as a way of mapping urls to your published content and/or use a publishing server that is configured via DHCP if possible.  Configure the firewall to block all IP addresses on the 'anti-P2P' and government lists that are
published.<p>Payment is tricky, but not impossible.  Look into USPS international money orders as a form of payment.  The longer a pre-paid cell phone number is active in the system, the more it is trusted by automated fraud services.
Use your ‘workstation’ and pre-paid cell phones to create free email accounts as needed, avoiding major services like hotmail, yahoo, and google.<p>One could also publish by uploading stego’d pictures to a free porn site via one’s ‘workstation’.

This can take the form of pandering to corporate interests so that said corporations open up their new offices within said Congresspersons constituency (i.e. bringing new jobs into the area!). It can also take the form of voting on crap laws to look 'tough on crime' or 'tough on child porn' or whatever.<p>I doubt very much that many of the people in Congress see it as a 'power grab' even if that is essentially what it is.,3332298,{3333849},,,,

Story may or may not be true. Reference links included.<p>A few details about Iran, I personally consider established:<p>* Iran is not 'trying to produce nuclear weapons', as endlessly claimed by Israel/USA. Because Iran already possesses nuclear weapons, and has since the mid '90s. They bought a dozen or so from one of the ex-Soviet states, and probably more since.
Israel and USA governments know this. It is the sole reason Iran has not so far been attacked by Israel/USA. Fear of retaliation. If the Zionist entity could ever be sure they knew the location of all Iranian nukes, they'd attack within minutes.<p>* All the talk of 'Iranian nuclear weapons development' is Orwell-speak code, for the _real_ reason the Zionists loathe Iran's fully legal, peaceful nuclear power program. This is because Iran is refining Uranium fuel for their reactor. Also legal under international law. But... the byproduct is Depleted Uranium. Which may be used to produce DU anti-armor penetrating shells. There has never been an instance of Zionist armed forces (NATO, Isreal, USA, etc) facing on the battlefield an opponent possessing DU shells. That asymmetry is NATO's SOLE battlefield advantage. They are totally terrified of finding themselves in a real fight without that advantage.<p>* Iran is not the aggressor. Iran has NEVER been an aggressor. The true villains in this stand-off are Israel and their insane, megalomaniac 'Eretz Israel' expansionist ambition. With the USA as a politically captive thug acting on behalf of Israel.<p>I'm cheering for the Iranians. And I'm quite able to accept that the Zionists would be preparing to launch an unprovoked biological warfare attack on Iran. It's exactly the kind of thing Israel and the USA governments would do.<p>Here's hoping there's a Second American Revolution before these lunatics can start WWIII.<p>But I'm not very hopeful.",3331308,,,,,

The iPad is a useful device beyond being a textbook reader and $15 to buy a textbook for class would be fantastic (I might pay $15 to get rid of some of the textbooks cluttering my shelf).<p>I don't think this college textbooks are an interesting space, however, since individuals are largely responsible for purchasing their own books. Disrupting institutional buying is game changing especially in a world where many if not most school districts are facing budget pressure year after year. This is who Algebra I, Geometry, and Biology textbooks are for, not college students. If they are the primary customer of these resources, I would expect a clear advantage in both the product and the price - similar to how digital encyclopedias and wikipedia completely eliminated the business model of the multi-volume, hard copy encyclopedia. The product appears, at face value, clearly better: up to date content, interactivity, multimedia, zero weight and volume. As far as I can tell, the price, however, is significantly higher than the incumbent product with no ""results"" to justify the increased price.<p>As someone who is interested in selling software solutions to customers, I find pitches like this interesting. I also come from a family of teachers (wife, parents, in-laws, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.) and feel I can empathize with school's position as a potential customer.",3485725,,,,,

Just an unconscious muscle twitch and (with newer kindles, and all iPads), I'm onto the next page.  I've had many a 12+ hour reading sessions, and several ""Get sucked into a book"" weekends with digital texts.<p>Volatility - My books are in the Amazon Cloud.  All of my digital books are still available to me.  100%.  I have access to about 5% of the paper books I've purchased in my life.  The _worst_ case scenario, is that Digital Books become as Volatile as paper books, if Amazon.com goes out of business, and I'm stuck with (horrors) the physical representation of the book as present on my kindle/iPad (and Laptop backup, and back blaze backup of my Laptop).<p>The cloud changes everything for volatility.<p>DRM Sucks.  Big Time.  With that said, Amazon's implementation only impact is that I don't casually lend books to other - which I typically never have anyways, so no impact on me.  I too like (and frequently take use) of the fact that 100% of my books are available on my Kindle, iPad, iPhone, Laptop, and CloudReader.<p>But - with that said - the DRM on physical books is pretty harsh too - You need to go to a photocopier to make a copy of the book.  I just lend my mother my cloud reader account, and she can read any of my books on the web.  Or lend a second friend my Kindle, and voila - he has all of my books.  While I still have all of them on my iPad and iPhone.  Or, if I don't have five lent out, I can pull them onto my old K2.<p>I don't think DRM on the kindle has ever stopped me from reading, or lending a book to someone I know.  It _does_ prevent casual lending.  Agreed there.<p>I haven't read a paper book in about 4 years.  I find it bizarre to even consider moving back to them.",3485724,,,,,

Toronto PHP jobs start at 60k and many are in the 70's and 80's. I've heard an even larger gulf for Java devs, especialy as you get up to the senior ranks.

I will have a green card in about 18 months, but meanwhile if I work, the employer must sponsor me for a visa.<p>This makes me nearly unemployable. The number of employers willing to deal with the visa process is vanishingly small, consequently there are very few -- if any -- jobs available to me.

Instead they sort of double dipped. You can read articles like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_fibre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_fibre</a> perhaps as a starting point, but essentially they charged their customers a special government mandated fee, that allowed them to build it out but not actually have to hook it up anywhere, and then when everyone forgot about this fee and what this really was, then treated as this new asset they could sell off, all while never actually figuring out the last mile problem, which was the heart of the original law to begin with. So now with wireless it is the same thing, where terms get thrown around like ""bandwidth"" and ""capacity"" and while they want to, on one hand, say that these are limitations from the FCC or just plain physics, they are actually words to describe the fact that it is their towers, or the connections to the towers, that they purposefully keep limited in order to facilitate very high profit margins. So they tell their customers ""have all of this unlimited everything"" but they've only built out (of their own equipment mind you) the ability to service 10% maybe of what they sell, so that when people actually start using it, they can then blame the customer, all the while showing ever increasing profits to their shareholders. I would be very very suspect of anything any of the damned companies have to say about their own capacity, and be very careful not to assume that it is the airwaves that are full, but it is really their equipment that they've oversold.",3654246,,,,,

5686292,,comment,Millennium,2013-05-10 15:17:27,"The problem with what we call depression is not the depressive mode of thought, per se. The problem is that this mode of thought gets out of control.<p>The depressive mode of thought is a tool, and an important one. The brutal honesty of this way of thinking allows you to analyze situations more clearly, and in so doing, it allows you to make better decisions. Being able to enter this mode of thought was likely an important step in human evolution, and we all do it from time to time, even those of us who are not ""depressed"".<p>But like most tools, the depressive mode of thought can be dangerous. That same brutal honesty, applied to one's self, does not end well: our human imperfections basically guarantee that such analysis will tear at the psyche in ways that little else can.<p>It is said that we should not judge others because ""you weren't there; you don't know."" But that doesn't work when you apply it to yourself, because you were there; you do know. And so you analyze yourself, and your judgment inevitably comes out wanting. The next question is obvious: what should you do about that? Only there's usually not enough data to answer that question, so an obvious intermediate step emerges: more analysis. And so the spiral continues.<p>This makes the ability to leave the depressive mode of thought just as important, from an evolutionary and health standpoint, as the ability to enter it. Pick up the tool, use it as needed, and put it down again. What we call ""depression"" is essentially what happens when you can't put it down.<p>You can probably see where I'm going with this. I think we're going about treating depression the wrong way. We try to take the edge off the mode of thought, when we should really be targeting the mechanisms that let people go into and out of it. Those mechanisms, unfortunately, are poorly-understood today.<p>There's also very likely to be an extremely delicate balance: you have to let people out while also allowing them back in, lest some kind of ""antidepression"" take hold where they can no longer pick up the tool. I don't know what such a thing would be like; it's possible that we already know it, but under another name that might or might not be linked to what we currently call depression.",5685915,"{5688176,5695326,5688207}",,,,

See the work of Ted Bergstrom and Preston McAfee[1] on this for more details. What the exact incentives of the publishers are here is not entirely clear. They seem to care weakly about the over-all quality of the bundle, but they get little or no extra revenue from increasing page counts. Thus, the decision to starve journals for pages in light of strongly increasing submission rates is driven by the commercial interests of the publisher and is entirely contrary to the mission of fostering scholarly communication. This is a new, and I think compelling, reason to try to reclaim scholarly communication back from commercial publishers and into the community of scholars, and is the main point I would like to be taken from this letter.""<p>edit: additional summary<p>The letter starts with the position that journals have become irrelevant for scholarly communication, which has been my experience in Economics, although I get the impression from other people here that that's not universal across fields.  But (again from TFA), despite being irrelevant for communication, journals are important for promotion, hiring, etc., and that their low acceptance rates are causing serious problems.

If all consumers could get all the deals everywhere--throughout their whole shopping list--the grocery stores wouldn't profit.",1784741,"{1785699,1785649}",,,,

1785342,,comment,onan_barbarian,2010-10-13 00:01:08,"Some of the ideas in Plan 9 are utterly fantastic.<p>/proc comes from Plan 9, and I remember being awed by the Plan 9 filesystem, which used memory and hard disks to cache a giant WORM jukebox (in the Bell Labs version, anyhow). I forget what the path was but you could just transparently go and have a look at the whole file system on any given day and wander around a read-only version of the fs for that day.<p>I'm sure there's a lot out there that looks like this now, but this was in 1992/1993.<p>The compiler was also cool as hell but lacked any of the aggressive optimizations that even gcc has now. It was very much oriented towards incredibly fast compile times rather than squeezing out the last x% of performance through optimization. I believe that the go compiler is a descendant of this one.<p>On the negative side, it was a very insular culture with an attitude that 'things we don't need to do aren't worth doing'. Avoiding shared libraries is fine, I guess, as is having a minimalist GUI approach. But telling people that shared libraries suck and shouldn't be used and using the fact that _you've_ got a tiny static library that does all the GUI stuff _you_ need as proof seems a bit rich, when the GUI that you produced doesn't have any of the conventional features of a GUI library. When so many things are being changed at once it's pretty easy to conflate two unrelated things into a 'win' (e.g. 'haha, we don't have a lame shared library system on our machine, and by the way, Motif sucks anyhow').<p>It's fine up to a point but it was starting to ring very hollow when you had go to another machine to run a web browser that looks even faintly like an actual web browser.<p>This may all have changed; it's been a long time since I had anything to do with P9. But I think the 90s are the point where Plan 9 decisively 'missed the boat' and the insularity and general attitude was part of the problem. If 'ape' (ANSI Posix environment) had been better maintained and taken seriously Plan 9 might have been considerably more popular and its alternate (frequently superior) ways of doing things might have taken off.",1782504,,,,,

(Not sure what HN best practice is on this one.)<p>Regarding the trans stuff: I did really read it, yes. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve been reading Penny Arcade since 2000, and it&#x27;s been in my RSS reader as long as I&#x27;ve used one. Did you any of what he said on Twitter?<p>The man&#x27;s sincere in his contrition, but his shoot from the hip style without thinking about what other people think plus his penchant for lashing out is insane.<p>I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s just paying lip service. I think he&#x27;s probably a nice guy at heart. If you want my honest opinion, I think he&#x27;s unaware of a lot of (dare I say it) privilege that he has, and reacts with hostility when called on it.<p>So again I am willing to take his trans apologies at face value. But it&#x27;s part of a pattern, and maybe after stepping in it a few times, the guy could take at least a <i>little</i> more care.<p>I don&#x27;t think this makes him a villain, and I suspect he&#x27;d find this criticism fair, as he has explicitly discussed this in the past. I give him credit for being self-aware.<p>Maybe I can summarize it like this: it&#x27;s strange to hear people (not necessarily you) intimate that a) he has nothing to apologize for because he&#x27;s a flawed but nice guy, and b) he&#x27;s apologized so stop with the criticism. We wouldn&#x27;t be here in the first place if the guy maybe thought a little bit more about how he communicates.

That taught me a lot of valuable lessons about life and work (perhaps not always in the moment, but it was at times useful to go back to those memories later in life, anyway), and it was great to feel a little in the loop, so it also taught me something about the value of communicating with your loved ones.
